ABOUT THIS POSTING
------------------
This is a ( rather rough) listing of likely questions and
information about , a program for public key mail encryption.  It
(this FAQ, not ) was written and will be maintained by Marc
VanHeyningen, <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a
variety of  on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific
to  is redirected to the group alt.security..

This month, I have ormatted this posting in an attempt to comply
with the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy
manipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me know
what you .

DISCLAIMER
----------
Nothing in this FAQ  be considered legal advice, or anything
other than one person's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk
to a real lawyer.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
---------------------

1)  What is ?

  is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using
 the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your
 electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who
 sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except
 the intended recipient.)

  was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.
 Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,
 which are a library called RSA licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.

2)  How can I get ?

  contains the library of cryptographic routines RSA, which is
 considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from 
 to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or
 Canada.  Theore, the following request is quoted from the README
 file:

 #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this 
 #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,
 #the author of , and a condition of your use of .

 Note that RSA is not in the public domain, and a license for it is
 included with the .  You  read it before using
 .

 The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy,  this will
 reduce the load on  sites that do carry it (not to mention the
 humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the
 friend.

  is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents
 in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsa/ and read the README file for
 info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and
 does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version.

 , as well as some other crypt stuff, has its "home site" on
 rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the
 U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out
 how to obtain access, ftp , cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file
 GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are
 available here in addition to the full source tree.

3)  Will  run on my machine?

 Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of
 Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to
 Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice
 Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports
 are expected, and help of users is invited.

4)  Will  work with my mailer?

 Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend
 on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users
 guide, included with the , discusses ways to use 
 with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.
 Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of  inside GNU
 Emacs.

 If you make a new interface for  or create an improvement on one
 in the  which you believe is convenient to use, secure,
 and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security..

5)  What is RSA?

 RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This 
 that  are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to
 decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,
 you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your
 decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public
 key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to
 decrypt it.  (Note that the "message" sent with RSA is normally just
 the DES key to the real message. (See "What is DES?")

 Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication,
 the fingerprint of the message (See "What is a fingerprint, like
 MD5?") is encrypted with the 's private key.  The recipient can
 use the 's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message
 must have come from the .

 RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who
 invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in
 pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.

6)  What is DES?

 DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or
 secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to
 encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.

  uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts
 your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the
 recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,
 allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.

 DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a
 key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it
  be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large
 corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future
 s will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using
 multiple encryption with DES.

7)  What is PEM, and how does  relate?

 PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of
 encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; 
 documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.

  is not  a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM
 specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which  does not
 handle at this time.   addition is planned.

8)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?

 For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know
 your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message
 received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important
 that this information be accurate; if a "bad guy" convinces her that
 his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.

  allows for three methods of key management: a central server,
 the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are
 described in the  users guide which is part of the .
 None of them provide perfect security.

9)  Why do all  public keys look very similar?

  public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various
 characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in
 your key may be the same as  of lots of other people's keys.
 This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the
 same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the
 same length, etc.

10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?

 MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.
 It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,
 of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not
 possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a
 different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,
 instead of signing the entire message with the 's private key,
 only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.

 MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often
 used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a
 passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.

 MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in
 RFC 1321.

11)  What is PGP?

 PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.
 PGP has been around longer than , and works somewhat differently.
 PGP is not compatible with  in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.

 Some major diff between PGP and :

 - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without
   a direct network connection.

 -  conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of
   working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible
   with anything other than PGP (in fact, PGP 1.0 is not compatible with
   PGP 2.0.)

 -  uses RSA, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security
   Inc.  RSA comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.
   PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus,
   PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims
   that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in
   the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGP's original
   author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation:

   #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, 
   #you n't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public
   #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is
   #contraband.  

 - Both PGP and  are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside
   the U.S. and Canada.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites
   in Europe and other places.

 Whether you use PGP or  or whatever, the documentation to PGP is
 recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.

 Note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export
 restrictions, are somewhat controversial; many people  it
 n't be that way, and some people interpret various documents
 differently.  Unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably
 seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in
 misc.legal.computing.  (See:  "DISCLAIMER")

12)  What about RPEM?

 RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to ,
 but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in
 an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA.  It was written by Mark
 Riordan, the same author as .

 Its  was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many
 (including Rabin), Public Key Partners (PKP) claimed that  patent
 was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested
 in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes, not just RSA.
 This claim is not universally accepted by any , but was not
 challenged for pragmatic reasons.

 RPEM is not  used anymore.  It is not compatible with  or PGP.

13)  What is MIME?

 MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is
 described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup
 comp.mail.mime.  How PEM  interact with MIME is not yet entirely
 clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type
 application/x- in  to send  messages as MIME ones.  I
 hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on
 the matter.

14)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of ...

 You may wish to check the companion post "-attacks" which
 discusses some of the more obvious attacks on 's security and
 what procedures will minimize the risk.  's main "weak area" is
 probably key .

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
---------------------

1)  What is ?

  is a (not yet complete, but useful) implementation of Privacy
 Enhanced Mail (PEM).   allows your electronic mail to have the
 four security facilities provided by PEM: disclosure protection
 (optional), originator authenticity, message integrity measures, and
 non-repudiation of origin (always).  (See: "What is PEM?")

  was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.
 Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,
 which are a library called RSA licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.

 The current version of  is 1.0.5; the current version of the
 Macintosh port of  is 0.7.

2)  How can I get ?

  uses the library of cryptographic routines RSA, which is
 considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from 
 to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the U.S or
 Canada without an export license.  No such license has been obtained
 (nor  one likely be granted unless the RSA key exchange were
 shortened to 512 bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something
 weaker than DES.   are some suggestions that this situation may
 change now that Clinton is in office.)  The author requests in the
 README file that this law not be violated:

 #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this 
 #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,
 #the author of , and a condition of your use of .

 Note that RSA is not in the public domain, and a license for it is
 included with the .  You  read it before using
 .

  is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent
 residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsa/ and read the README
 file for info.  Note that the non-RSA portion of  is not a
 product of RSA Data Security, Incorporated; they merely are helping
 distribute it.

 , as well as some other crypt stuff, has its "home site" on
 .msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the
 U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out
 how to obtain access, FTP , cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file
 GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are
 available here in addition to the full source tree.

3)  Will  run on my machine?

 Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of
 Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to
 Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice
 Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports
 are expected, and help of users is invited.

4)  Will  work with my mailer?

 Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend
 on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users
 guide, included with the , discusses ways to use 
 with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.

 Emacs.

 If you make a new interface for  or create an improvement on one
 in the  which you believe is convenient to use, secure,
 and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security..

5)  What is RSA?

 RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This 
 that  are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to
 decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,
 you may publish your encryption, or public, key widely and keep your
 decryption, or private, key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public
 key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to
 decrypt it.  Note that the "message" sent with RSA is normally just
 the DES key to the real plaintext. (See "What is DES?")

 Note that the above only provides for disclosure protection.  For
 originator authenticity, message integrity, and non-repudiation of
 origin services to be implemented, the fingerprint of the message
 (See "What is a fingerprint, like MD5?") is encrypted with the
 's private key.  The recipient, or a dispute-resolving
 authority, can use the 's public key to decrypt it and confirm
 that the message must have come from the  and was not altered.

 RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who
 invented it.  To find out lots more about RSA and modern cryptography
 in general, ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/.  Some information
 also may be in sci.crypt.

6)  What is DES?

 DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or
 secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to
 encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.

  uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts
 your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the
 recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,
 allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.

 DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a
 key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it
  be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large
 corporation or government agency.  It is not likely that the PEM
 standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the
 near future, because  is a strong feeling that PEM  be
 stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with
 interoperability.

7)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?

 MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.
 It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,
 of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not
 possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a
 different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,
 instead of signing the entire message with the 's private key,
 only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.

 MD5s can also be exchanged directly for authentication; for example,
  public keys include an MD5 of the public key in the file, so
 parties wishing to confirm  keys are authentic via a separate
 channel merely need exchange MD5s of keys and verify  accuracy.

 MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often
 used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a
 passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.

 MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in
 RFC 1321.

  have been some recent suggestions that MD5 may not be as strong
 a hash as was originally believed; presumably some other hash
 function will be used if this is accepted as true.

8)  What is PEM?

 PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a standard for allowing transfer of
 encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a
 working group of experts.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; 
 documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.

  is not  a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM
 specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which  does not
 handle at this time.   addition is planned.

9)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?

 For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know
 your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message
 received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important
 that this information be accurate; if a "bad guy" convinces her that
 his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.

  allows for three methods of key management: a central server,
 the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are
 described in the  users guide which is part of the .
 None of them provide perfect security.  The PEM standard calls for
 key management by certificates; the addition of this feature to 
 is planned, but chicken-egg issues  exist.

10)  Isn't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM?

 This issue has been considered in the standards process.  RFC 1310,
 the specification for Internet standards, has a discussion (section
 6) on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be
 met for a patented method to be included in a standard.  RFC 1421
 addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public-key
 cryptography.

 This does not, of course, mean that all questions are settled or that
 everyone is in agreement.  An interesting exchange on the use of
 patented algorithms in standards with regard to public-key
 cryptography is in the League for Programming Freedom archive
 (available via FTP: ftp.uu.net:/doc/lpf) in the files bidzos.letter
 and bidzos.response.  (Amusingly, the LPF files on ftp.uu.net are
 compressed with a patented algorithm.)

11)  What about RSADSI/PKP?

 RSA Data Security, Inc. (RSADSI) is a California-based company
 specializing in cryptographic technologies.  Public Key Partners is a
 firm which holds exclusive sub-licensing rights of the following U.S.
 patents and all of  corresponding foreign patents:

      Cryptographic Apparatus and Method
      ("Diffie-Hellman")............................... No. 4,200,770

      Public Key Cryptographic Apparatus
      and Method ("Hellman-Merkle").................... No. 4,218,582

      Cryptographic Communications System and
      Method ("RSA")................................... No. 4,405,829

      Exponential Cryptographic Apparatus
      and Method ("Hellman-Pohlig").................... No. 4,424,414

 PKP claims  four patents cover all known methods of public key
 cryptography.  The two businesses are rather closely related (for
 example, the same person, Jim Bidzos, is president of both of them.)
 PKP has licensed this technology to a considerable number of
 companies (IBM, DEC, Motorola, AT&T, Lotus...) for use in 
 products.  PKP has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending 
 patents.

  was originally created with no connection to RSADSI other than
 its use of the RSA library, and for no reason other than its
 author's desire to see widespread use of public-key cryptography.
 However, after the ball started rolling, people at RSADSI got
 interested.  RSADSI decided to carry  on its FTP site, and some
 people  started making  own  keys and contributing
 code.   even won the "Best Application Built on RSA in 1992"
 award.

12)  Why do all  public keys look very similar?

  public keys begin with a PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography
 Standards) identifier describing various characteristics about the
 key, so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as
  of lots of other people's keys.  This does not mean your keys
 are similar, but only that they are the same class of key, were
 generated with the same program, are of the same length, etc.

13)  What is PGP?

 PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.
 PGP has been around longer than , and works somewhat differently.
 PGP is not compatible with  in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.

 A few major diff between PGP and :

 - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without
   a direct network connection.

 -  conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability
   of working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be
   compatible with anything other than itself.

 -  uses RSA, a library of RSA routines from RSADSI which
   comes with a license allowing noncommercial use.  PGP uses its own
   implementation of RSA.  PKP claims that it is a violation of its
   patents to "make, use or sell" PGP in the U.S. or Canada without
   either a license or written permission.  (See: "DISCLAIMER")
   (See: "What about RSADSI/PKP?")  Phil Zimmermann, the author of
   PGP, stopped distributing it after  threatened with legal
   action; he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged, but
   it hasn't happened and  seems little prospect of it happening
   in the future.  He acknowledges in the PGP User's Guide:

   #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, 
   #you n't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public
   #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is
   #contraband.

 - Both PGP and  are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside
   the U.S. and Canada without an export license.  However, PGP
   already exists on many ftp sites in Europe and other places.

 Whether you use PGP or  or whatever, the documentation to PGP is
 recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.
 Unfortunately, it's not distributed separately from the program,
 which can be difficult to find in the U.S. on FTP sites due to
 liability concerns.

14)  What about RPEM?

 RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to ,
 but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in
 an attempt to avoid the patents on public-key systems.  It was
 written by Mark Riordan, who later wrote .

 Its  was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many
 (including Rabin), PKP claimed that  patents were broad enough
 to cover the cipher employed.  This claim is not universally
 accepted, but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons.

 RPEM is not  used anymore.  It is not compatible with  or PGP.

15)  What is MIME?

 MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is
 described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup
 comp.mail.mime; a FAQ exists on it.  How PEM  interact with
 MIME is not yet entirely clear; some people use the stopgap solution
 of having a MIME type application/x- in  to send 
 messages as MIME ones.  I hope some standards will emerge.  Draft
 Internet documents exist on the matter.

16)  What is TIS/PEM?

 Trusted Information Systems is working on a version of Privacy
 Enhanced Mail for general availability.  Last I heard, it was
 rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent (MH)
 rather than a stand-alone system, and in beta test.  I  know
 much more than that.

17)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of ...

 You may wish to check the companion post "-attacks" which
 discusses some of the more obvious attacks on 's security and

SOME POSSIBLE ATTACKS ON 
------------------------------

This is a living list of potential weaknesses to keep your eyes open
for when using  for secure electronic mail.  It does not go into
great detail, and is almost certainly not exhaustive.  Obviously, many
of the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in
general, and will pertain to secure mail programs other than .
It is maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It
is posted monthly to a variety of news groups; followups pertaining
specifically to   go to alt.security..

CRYPTANALYSIS ATTACKS
---------------------

- Breaking RSA  allow an attacker to find out your private key,
  in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign
  messages with your private key.

  RSA is generally believed to be resistant to all standard
  cryptanalytic techniques.  Even a standard key (about 516 bits with
  ) is long enough to render this impractical, barring a
  huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring.

- Breaking DES  allow an attacker to read any given message,
   the message itself is encrypted with DES.  It  not allow
  an attacker to claim to be you.

  DES has only 56 bits in its key, and thus could conceivably be
  compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware, but few agencies
  have such money to devote to simply read one message.   each
  message has a different DES key, the work for each message 
  remain high.

KEY MANAGEMENT ATTACKS
----------------------

- Stealing your private key  allow the same benefits as breaking
  RSA.  To safeguard it, it is encrypted with a DES key which is derived
  from a passphrase you type in.  However, if an attacker can get a copy
  of your private keyfile and your passphrase (by snooping network
  packets, tapping , or whatever) he could break the whole scheme.

  The main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the
  private key file across an untrusted link.  So  do that.  Run 
   on a trusted machine, perably one sitting right in front of
  you.  Ideally, your own machine in your own home (or maybe office)
  which nobody else has physical access to.

- Fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could 
  allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him
  rather than to the real recipient.  If the enemy can fool your
  intended recipient as well, he could re-encrypt the messages with
  the other bogus public key and pass them along.

  It is important to get the proper public keys of other people.
  The most common mechanism for this is finger; assuming the opponent
  has not compromised routers or daemons or such, finger can be 
  given a fair amount of trust.  The strongest method of key
  authentication is to exchange keys in person; however, this is
  not always practical.  Having other people "vouch for you" by
  signing a statement containing your key is possible, although 
   doesn't have features for doing this as automatically as
  PGP.   does generate and check MD5 fingerprints of public keys
  in the key files; they may be exchanged via a separate channel for
  authentication.

PLAYBACK ATTACKS
----------------

- Even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography, an opponent could
   cause difficulties.  For example, suppose you send a message
  with MIC-ONLY (a PEM mode which does not provide disclosure protection)
  to Alice which says "OK, let's do that." Your opponent intercepts
  it, and now resends it to Bob, who now has a message which is
  authenticated as from you telling him to do that.  Of course, he may
  interpret it in an entirely different context.  Or your opponent
  could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later,
  figuring it  be seen differently at a later time.  Or the
  opponent could change the Originator-Name: to himself, register 
  your public key as his, and send a message hoping the recipient
  will send him return mail indicating (perhaps even quoting!) the
  unknown message.

  To defeat playback attacks, the plaintext of each message  
  include some indication of the  and recipient, and a unique
  identifier (typically the date).  A good front-end script for 
   do this automatically (IMHO).  As a recipient, you  be
  sure that the Originator-Name: header and the  indicated within
  the plaintext are the same, that you  are a recipient, and that
  the message is not an old one.  Some this also can and  be
  automated.  The author of this FAQ has made a modest attempt at
  automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated
  headers; the programs are included in the standard  in
  the utils directory.

LOCAL ATTACKS
-------------

- Clearly, the security of  cannot be greater than the security of
  the machine where the encryption is performed.  For example, under
  UNIX, a super-user could manage to get at your encrypted mail,
  although it  take some planning and effort to do something like
  replace the  executable with a Trojan horse or to get a copy of
  the plaintext, depending how it's stored.

  In addition, the link between you and the machine running  is
  an extension of that.  If you decrypt with  on a remote machine
  which you are connected to via network (or, worse yet, modem), an
  eavesdropper could see the plaintext (and probably also your
  passphrase.)

    only be executed on systems you trust, obviously.  In
  the extreme case,   only be used on your own machine,
  which you have total control over and which nobody else has access
  to, which has only caully examined software known to be free of
  viruses, and so on.  However, 's a very real trade-off between
  convenience and security here.

  A more moderately cautious user might use  on a UNIX workstation
  where other people have access (even root access), but increase
  security by keeping private keys and the (statically linked, of
  course) executable on a floppy disk.

  Some people will keep  on a multi-user system, but when dialing
  in over an insecure line, they will download the message to 
  own system and perform the  decryption .  However, the
  security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory; 
  you presumably type your cleartext password to log in, you've just
  given away the store,  the attacker can now log in as you and
  install traps in your account to steal your private key next time
  you use it from a less insecure line.  This will likely remain the
  situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of
  cleartext password authentication.

  I find it nice to put a brief statement of how caully I manage my
  security arrangement in my .plan next to my public key, so that
  potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are
  in place.  Some people use two keys, a short one which is not
  caully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated
  with greater care for critical correspondence.

UNTRUSTED PARTNER ATTACKS
-------------------------

- 's encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key
  corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the
  traffic.  However, once someone with that key gets the message, she
  may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes.   
  exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient, say, taking an
  ENCRYPTED message and converting it to a MIC-ONLY message, signed by
  you and readable by anyone, although  does not provide this
  functionality.  Indeed, the latest PEM draft I have seen specifically
  states that such transformations  be possible to allow
  forwarding functions to work.
 
  Including the recipients in the plaintext, as mentioned above, will
  make it possible for recipients of a redistributed message to be aware
  of its original nature.  Naturally, the security of the cryptography
  can never be greater than the security of the people using it.

punctuated with a trip to the county jail, where one just happens to get

 are many Urban Legends (maybe this ought to be in the Crypt 
FAQ?) about what is actually sufficient to clear or declassify 
magnetic media when used for classified data.  Here is some 
information "from the horse's mouth".

(Regarding the sufficient overwriting of media ("clearing") meant to 
be *retained* within the controlled environment, or declassifying 
the material to be reused *outside* the controlled environment,)

From National Telecommunications and Information Systems 
Security (NTISS) "Advisory Memorandum on Office Automation 
Security Guide"  (NTISSAM COMPUSEC/1/87):

------

"7.6.2.1 Clearing of Magnetic Media

Certain types of removable media (e.g., magnetic tape, floppy disk, 
cassettes, and magnetic cards) may be cleared by overwriting the 
entire media one time with any one character.  Floppy disks may be 
cleared by applying a vendor's formatting program that over 
each location with a given character.

Fixed media (e.g., Winchester disks)  be cleared by overwriting 
at least one time with any one character.  One way to do this is by 
applying a vendor-supplied formatting program that over each 
location on the disk with a given character, if it can be shown that 
this program actually works as advertised.  The user  beware: 
some programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not 
actually do this.

Cleared media may be resides within the controlled facility or 
released for destruction; however, they  be marked and 
controlled at the level of the most restrictive sensitivity of 
information ever recorded.

7.6.2.2 Declassification of Magnetic Media

Certain types of removable media can be declassified using a 
degaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media of 
that type.  (A list of approved devices is maintained by the NSA.)

If a fixed medium (for example, a hard, or Winchester, disk) is 
operative, an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to 
employ an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all 
addressable locations at least three times by writing any character, 
then its complement (e.g., binary ones and binary zeros) 
alternatively.

When fixed  media become inoperative, it is impossible to declassify 
the media by the overwrite method.  In this case,  are two 
alternate procedures that may be used: (1) disassemble the disk 
pack, and degauss each platter with the appropriate approved 
degaussing equipment; and (2) courier the inoperative media to the 
vendor's facility, have the magnetic media (e.g., disk platter) 
removed in sight of the courier and returned to the courier for 
destruction at the secure site.  The vendor can then install new 
platters and repair any other problems with the disk unit.

7.6.3 Destruction of Magnetic Media"

Remanence Security Guideline", CSC-STD-003-85  FOR OFFICIAL USE

>[Lots of stuff.]

I hate to follow up to my own posting, but I  perhaps clarify
some things so I won't get flamed.

First of all, when I'm talking about ``factoring the modulus'' or a
``breakthrough in factoring'', what I  mean is a breakthrough in
the cryptanalysis of RSA.  I know that factoring and breaking RSA are
not proven to be equivalent; it's just so damn convenient not to
repeat this every time.

I also have to admit that I   know if the ``non-group''
property of a cipher is essential only for key chaining.  I have
thought about it a little , but I can't find a way that a
cryptanalyst could exploit a group structure.  That, of course, 
nothing at all.

Then I wrote,

>Please note that as long as it is much harder to factor a RSA modulus
>than it is to generate it, the increase in computer speed alone will
>keep key lengths and modulus factoring in lock-step, i.e., people will
>simply start using longer moduli and  be safe.

What I meant was that as long as the only advantage of the
cryptanalyst is a faster computer, then we will probably have RSA for
a long time to come, because even if 1024-bit moduli somehow could be
broken with fast computers (not with a new algorithm), then people
 simply use longer moduli.  Both users and cryptanalysts benefit
from better technology in the same way.

Hope this keeps the flames away...  Have fun.

After IBM had invented the DES and the NBS had advertised for proposals,
but before IBM had decided to respond, I argued strenuously that they 
 not; they  keep it proprietary. 

The biggest proponent of proposing was Dr. Lewis Branscomb.  Dr. Branscomb
was the IBM Chief Scientist and had come to IBM from NBS.  Fortunately
for all of us, Dr. Branscomb understood the answer to the above question
much better than I.  He realized how difficult it  be to gain
acceptance for any cryptographic mechanism.  Because of the necessary
complexity, publicity  not be sufficient and neither  
authority.  In fact, it has taken both of  plus more than 15 
years.

We have also had independence.  The DES was solicited by NBS, invented
and proposed by IBM, and vetted by NBS.  It has also been examined and
vetted by experts like Adi Shamir, who are not  to influence by
any of .

Even now,  are  people posting on this list who do not trust
the DES in spite of all the time, all of the analysis, and all of the
public scrutiny.

(Of course, it is just this point that NIST misses when it attempts to 
gain acceptance for a novel mechanism, developed in secret, on the basis
of authority alone.)

We had a long thread here about whether or not the NSA can "break" the
DES.  That is a silly question.  At some cost and in some time they
can "break" anything.  The important question is at what cost and in
what time.

The fundamental strength of the DES and RSA are not nearly so important
as what we know about  strength.  As long as we understand the
cost and duration for an attacker, then we can use them in a safe way.
At this point, we may never replace either because of the inability of
any successor to overcome this knowledge gap.

DES and RSA are among the most significant inventions of the century
and the most important inventions in the history of cryptography.
We are damned lucky to have them.

This assumes the person is using the hardware debug instruction of an X86

Legal or not, I've seen it done.  Phone records were obtained
in  to *establish* probable cause, rather than as a result of it.
In other words, for a fishing expedition.

And does the phone company require written, subpoena-able evidence
of probable cause in  to process the request?  I suggest that
the officer was disinterested in pursuing your case -- even if you
could prove the offender had called you at a certain time, your 
chances of winning a harassment suit on the strength of this evidence
are nil.  My contact with several people who have dealt with cases
of extreme phone harassment (several thousand calls in one case) teaches 
me that police in this area are quite lethargic about pursuing such matters.

This actually supports Bill's speculation - IF  is a backdoor in
RSA and IF PKP is supported secretly by the NSA, then it is more
than natural that they will welcome ANY public-key implementation that
uses RSA and will strongly oppose themselves against ANY
implementation that doesn't.

I personally cannot see how one could put a backdoor in a
long-precision modular arithmetic library that comes in source, but,
of course, the fact that -I- cannot see it  nothing...

Uh, I'm afraid that your information is slightly out of date... PKWare

It is MUCH easier, faster, and probably even more secure to use Norton
Utilties 6.0 (I'm talking IBM PC here) and to tell WipeInfo to (a)
clean the free disk space and (b) clean the slack space at the end of
the files. Use to Government standard option for more caul

My speculation does not include or depend upon a trapdoor in RSA. I
do not believe that RSA  consent to such.  

However,  are other limitation in the concept of RSA in which
NSA has an interest.  It has an interest in a limited number of
implementations, i.e., targets.  It has an interest in fixed key or
maximum modulus size.  

It has a legitimate (literally) right to pursue such interests.  Within
bounds, it probably has a right to pursue  interests by covert
.  At least it has the same right as the rest of us not to disclose
all of its motives and intentions.  (Institutions are not self-aware;
they do not know  intentions in any meaningful sense.)

The original one-way encryption I put into Multics about 1968 (as suggested

by Joe Weizenbaum) was invertible.  An Air Force tiger team demonstrated 
this to me in May 1973.  I then asked an expert (who requested anonymity) 
what I  use instead; the expert's suggestion was to treat the 
8-byte password as both key and data for the LUCIFER encryption algorithm, 
which is similar or identical to DES.  This method or something stronger 
 take care of (a).  Issue (b) is discussed in comp.security.misc: 
longer passwords and quality control on what users can choose as passwords
are the common tactics.

HMMM... that brings up a neat idea.  

Unfortunately, it's SOOO neat, I  I ought to patent it.

So I can't tell you about it.

The law is much worse than worthless.  It gives police the power to put
innocent people in jail because they (the police) find something they 
understand.  Most police  know what the return key does, never mind the
difference between a core file and classified military secrets.

 are plenty of scenarios where the user  have no idea what something
is either.  It could be uninitialized junk.  The burden of proof is on the
user to show that it's something a normal upstanding citizen  have.  No
one  ever be put in that situation, especially in America.

What's disgusting about this is how easily most people go along with it, to
provide a bargaining chip against some hypothetical *alleged* child molester
or drug dealer, or whatever bad thing is in style at the time.  Basically most
people  have a clear distinction between criminals and suspects.

As an analogy, it's like they find a loose screw in your house, and they
insist that you're building a bomb or machine gun.  They ask you where it came
from (like you'd know), and ask you to prove your claim.  When you explain it
in such simple terms, people may start to get the idea.

As a matter of fact, i do keep random files on my disk.  The reason is,
without special-purpose hardware, it takes a long time to generate good random
bits.  I have programs that crank out a couple bits per minute, which is
pretty conservative, but over time that's more than i need.

If you  about it, 's no point in actually encrypting random data,
because it just gives you different random data.  If you want some data to
look like an encrypted file, you just put an appropriate header on it.  If
enough people do this, some of them will be put in jail.

When you get arrested and the police ask for your keys, you can tell them it's
just random junk, although of course they won't believe you.   you're
sitting in jail, you can take consolation in the fact that the government will
burn a few CPU-years trying to find something that's not .

People have been encrypting notes in  notebooks for hundreds of years
-- maybe over a thousand.  It's a long tradition dating at least back to
the alchemists.

I know of nothing bad happening to them.  I  assume that nothing bad
 happen to you, given this long history establishing encryption as
the property of individuals, to do with as they please.

You've overlooked a fundamental Truth:

	both headcount and budget of any government agency are
	monotonic increasing functions.

Given that Truth, you need to look for what the agency can do to occupy
all  people and spend all that money when crypto is unbreakable.

Perhaps they could talk the world's telephone companies into making equipment
they could break into and tap.

Maybe they could convince people that distributed computing was a good idea
so that even the internal state of a process  be available for access
by wiretapping.

Maybe....

   Better yet, instead of thrashing around on the DOS file system, take
it a step further.  Write yourself a minimal "file system" program that
is used to create/delete files, en/decrypt them to ramdisk, list a
directory. Put the util, password protected, on a floppy.

   The catch is that the storage space used by this util is NOT part
of the DOS file system.  Instead, defrag your disk, thus packing all
allocated clusters into clusters 0-n.  Then use the back end of the
partition to hold your 'stealth' file system.  Or, leave a small 2nd
partition on the disk that is not assigned to DOS.  Another approach
might be to use a directory that contains a set of invariant files (DOS
system files, for instance).  Due to DOS allocating a minimum storage 
unit of a "cluster"  is unused physical space on the disk between
the tail end of each file and the end of its associated cluster. 
dead spaces could be concatenated and used to hold your stealth file
system.

   Now you have a situation where no encrypted data "appears" on your
disk at all :-).

For your application, what you can do is to encrypt the real-time clock

For a good discussion of cryptographically "good" random number
generators, check out the draft-ietf-security-randomness-00.txt
Internet Draft, available at your local friendly internet drafts
repository. 

A reasonably source of randomness is the output of a cryptographic
hash function (e.g., MD5), when fed with a large amount of
more-or-less random data. For example, running MD5 on /dev/mem is a
slow, but random enough, source of random bits;  are bound to be
128 bits of entropy in the tens (or hundreds) of megabytes of data in
a modern workstation's memory, as a fair amount of them are system
timers, i/o buffers, etc.

But they can make you piss in a jar, and possibly provide DNA, semen,
and hair samples or to undergo tests for gunpowder residues on your hand.

(BTW, that was why the chemical engineer arrested in the WTC explosion
thrust his hands into a toilet filled with urine as the cops were breaking
down the door -- the nitrogen in the urine  mask any residue from
explosives.  I found it interesting the news reported his acts, but not
his reasons).

Somewhere, perhaps a privacy group, they discussed the legal ramifications
of using a password like

  I shot Jimmy Hoffa and his body is in a storage locker in Camden

a  back.  The impression I got was that real judges  dismiss
arguments that this password is self-incrimination as first-year law
school sophistry -- the fact that you use a statement for a password has
no bearing on the veracity of that phrase.

You are not  asked to incrimidate yourself (e.g., "where did you
bury the body?"); you are  asked to provide information necessary
to execute a legal search warrant.  using to provide the password is
akin to using to provide a key to a storage locker... except that they
could always _force_  way into the locker.

Of course, that doesn't mean you have to help them _understand_ what
they find, or point out things they overlooked in  search!

Haven't you read any of Noam Chomsky's works? A widely used information net
outside the control of the 'right people' is unable. Hundreds of billions
of dollars will be spent to wipe it out, sorry, 'regulate and  it' once
the major media and poitical powers wake up to the efect it can have.

If you can't be bod reading, get the video "Manufacturing Consent".

     1. Do a straight encryption of your keyrings and put the
        results with misleading names somewhere they won't be noticed
        (eg. in the \windows directory; nobody knows what half 
        files are).

     2. Do a straight encryption of a .BAT file that will decrypt
        the keyrings to RAMdisk and will set PGPPATH to point at it.

     3. Set up another .BAT file to decrypt and execute the first
        (again on RAM disk). Have it take the name of the target file
        as an argument so that  is no link between this file and
        the (non-existent) batch file erred to by the rest of the
        system. Comment it so it looks like a test script for fooling
        around with PGP. Set PGPPATH to the PGP directory.

     4. Leave the original keyrings that came with PGP in the
        directory with PGP; a good indication that you are playing
        with, but haven't made serious use of PGP. Add a set of keys
        with your name and a  simple passphrase. Never use it,
        or use it as your widely published key for low-security
        e-mail.

     5. When needed, run the second .BAT file. Make sure all
        intermediate and plainfiles are generated on RAMdisk.

     6. When you hear the concussion grenade, hit the power switch.
        
        Cheers,

voice exemplars, and to take blood and DNA tests.

No, but they could compell you to produce the key to a safe where, as it
happens, evidence that will convict you is stored. 

The crypto-key disclosure issue hasn't come up yet, but current law
suggests that it's a loser for the defendant--he'll be compelled to turn
over the key.

The test for compelled self-incrimination is whether the material to 
be disclosed *in itself* tends to inculpate the discloser. In the example
I gave above, the safe key itself has no testimonial value--ergo, it can
be disclosed under compulsion (e.g., subpoena duces tecum).

Moreover, the government can always immunize the disclosure of a crypto
key--compelling you to disclose the key at the price of not using the fact
of your disclosure as evidence in the case against you. Of course, they
can use whatever they discover as a result of this disclosure against
you.

All I have to say is this is full of shit.  I have negotiated a license

sliding scale depending on your capitalization.  If you are a startup

Why do people insist on making unequivocal statements about that which

It is and you are wrong yet you emotionally state a bunch of crap as fact

Why is  such a strong correlation between interest in cryptography
and immaturity I wonder.

IDENTITY
========

_____
<1.1> What is `identity' on the internet?

  Generally, today people's `identity' on the internet is primarily
  determined by  email address in the sense that this is 
  most unchanging 'face' in the electronic realm.   This is your
  login name qualified by the complete address domain information,
  for example ``ld231782@longs.lance..edu''.  People see
  this address when receiving mail or reading USENET posts from you
  and in other situations where programs record usage.  Some obsolete
  forms of addresses (such as BITNET)  persist.

  In email messages, additional information on the path that a message
  takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient.  This
  information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the
  transmission and is a very accurate trace of its origination.  This
  type of identify-and-forward protocol is also used in the USENET
  protocol to a lesser extent.  Forging  fields requires
  corrupted mailing software at sites involved in the forwarding and
  is very uncommon.  Not so uncommon is forging the chain at the
  origination point, so that all initial sites in the list are faked
  at the time the message is created.  Tracing  messages can be
  difficult or impossible when the initial faked fields are names of
  real machines and represent real transfer routes.

_____
<1.2> Why is identity (un)important on the internet?

  The concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication,
  privacy, and security, which in turn are all critical aspects of
  computer networks. For example, the convenience of communication
  afforded by email  be impossible without conventions for
  identification.  But  are many potential abuses of identity
  possible that can have very severe consequences, with massive
  computer networks at the foront of the issue, which can
  potentially either exacerbate or solve  problems.

  Verifying that an identity is correct is called `authentication',
  and one classic example of the problems associated with it is
  H.G.Well's ``War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast that fooled
  segments of the population into ing that an alien invasion was
  in progress.  Hoaxes of this  are not uncommon on Usenet and
  forged identities makes them more insidious.  People and 
  reputations can be assaulted by forgery.

  However, the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of
  its most attractive features. Identity is just as useful as it is
  harmful.  A professor might caully explain a topic until he
  finds he is talking to an undergraduate. A person of a particular
  occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally
  shun him.  Some prejudices are erased, but, on the other hand, many
  prejudices are useful!  A scientist might argue he can better
  evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more
  about the authors.  Likewise, he may be more likely to reject it
  based on unfair or irrelevant criteria.  On the other side of the
  connection,  the author may find identities of reviewers useful in
  exerting pressure for acceptance.

  Identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating
  `credit' (not necessarily financial) and `ownership' and `usage'. 
  Many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques
  for identification. Heavy reliance will be placed on digital
  authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic. 
  Many government functions and services are based on identification,
  and law enforcement frequently hinges on it.  Hence, employees of
  many government s push toward stronger identification
  structures.  But when does identification invade privacy?

  The growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive
  proportions. Decisions made now on issues of identity will affect
  many future users, especially as the network becomes increasingly
  global, universal, widespread, and entrenched; and the positive or
  adverse affects of  actions, intended and inadvertent,  will
  literally be magnified exponentially.

_____
<1.3> How does my email address (not) identify me and my background?

  Your email address may contain information that influences people's
  perceptions of your background.  The address may `identify' you as
  from a department at a particular , an employee at a
  company, or a government worker.  It may contain your last name,
  initials, or cryptic identification codes independent of both.  In
  the US some are based on parts of social security numbers.  Others
  are in the form 'u2338' where the number is incremented in the
   that new users are added to the system.

  Standard internet addresses  also can contain information  on your
  broad geographical location or nationhood.  However, none of this
  information is guaranteed to be correct or be  at all.  The
  fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on
  rather arbitrary , such as (mostly invisible) network
  cabling s.  The only point to make is that early fields
  in the address are more specific (such as specific computer names
  or local networks) and the later ones the most general (such as
  continental domains).  Typically the first field is the name of the
  computer receiving mail.

  Gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an
  inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise.  (For more
  information, see the FAQs on email  addresses and known
  geographical s below.)  However, UNIX utilities exist
  to aid in the quest (see the question on this).

  Common Suffixes
  ---------------

  .us    United States
  .uk    United Kingdom
  .ca    Canada
  .fi    Finland

  .org   'other' (e.g. nonprofit )
  .gov   government
  .mil   military site
 
_____
<1.4> How can I find out more about somebody with a given email address?

  One simple way is to send email to that address, asking.  Another
  way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address (i.e.
  postmaster@address), although the postmaster's job is more to help
  find user ID's of particular people given  real name and solve
  mail routing problems.  The sysadmin (i.e. `root@address') may also
  be able to supply information.  Users with related email address
  may have information.  However, all of  methods rely on the
  time and patience of others so use them minimally.

  One of the most basic tools for determining identity over the
  internet is the UNIX utility 'finger'.  The basic syntax is:

    finger user@here..everywhere

  This utility uses communication protocols to query the computer
  named in the address for information on the user named.  The
  response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may
  be in any format.  Possible responses are as follows:

  - A message `unknown host' meaning some aspect of the address is
    incorrect, two  with no information and '???'.
  
  - A message 'In real life: ???' in which case the receiving computer
    could not find any kind of a match on the username. The finger
    utility may return this response in other situations.
  
  - A listing of information associated with multiple users. Some
    computers will search only for matching user IDs, others will
    attempt to find the username you specified as a substring of all
    actual full names of users kept in a local database.
  
  At some sites 'finger' can be used to get a list of all users on the
  system with a `finger @address'.  In general this is often
  considered weak security, however, because `attackers' know valid
  user ID's to `crack' passwords.

  More information on the fields returned by `finger' is given below. 
  More information on `finger' and locating people's email addresses
  is given in the email FAQ (such as the WHOIS lookup utility).  Just
  as you can use   to find out about others, they can use
  them to find out about you.  You can `finger' yourself to find out
  what is publicly reported by your UNIX system about you.  Be
  caul when modifying `finger' data; virtually anyone with
  internet access worldwide can query this information.  In one
  amazing case, the New York Times writer J. Markoff uncovered the
  identity of R. Morris, author of the Internet Worm,  through
  the use of an anonymous tip and 'finger'.  See the book Cyberspace
  by K. Hafner and J. Markoff.

_____
<1.5> Why is identification (un)stable on the internet?

  Generally, identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept
  on the Internet for a variety of reasons.  One is the inherent
  fluidity of `cyberspace' where people emerge and submerge
  frequently, and absences are not readily noted in the `community'. 
  Most people remember faces and voices, the primary  of casual
  identification in the 'real world'.  The arbitary and cryptic 
  sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are
  not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique
  identification of an individual, who may use multiple accounts on
  multiple machines anywhere in the world.

  Currently internet users do not  have any great assurances
  that the messages in email and USENET are from who they appear to
  be. A person's mailing address is far from an identification of an
  individual.  
  
  - Anyone with access to the account, e.g. they know the password,
    either legitimately or otherwise, can send mail with that address
    in the From: line.
  
  - Email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as
    they switch jobs or make moves inside  s. 

  - As part of current mailing protocol standards, forging the From:
    line in mail messages is a fairly trivial operation for many
    hackers.
    
  The status and path information prepended to messages by
  intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable. In general, 
  possible, forgeries are fairly rare on most  and in
  email.  Besides  pathological cases abve  are many basic
  problems with today's internet protocols affecting identification
  on the internet:

  - Internet mail standards, described in RFC-822, are  evolving
    rapidly and not entirely ly.  For example, standards for
    mail address `munging' or `parsing' tend to vary slightly between
    sites and frequently mean the difference between finding
    addresses and bouncing mail.
  
  - Domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites,
    and  are delays in the propagation of this data.
  
  - Addresses cannot be resolved when certain critical computers
    crash, such as the receiving computer or other computers involved
    in resolving names into addresses called `nameservers'. 
  
  - A whole slew of problems is associated with  `nameservers'; if
    they are not updated they will not find name addresses, and even
    the operation of what constitutes `updating' has different
    interpretations at different sites.
  
  The current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly
  anachronistic in that they were created when the network was
  somewhat obscure and not widespread, with only a fraction of the
  traffic it now sees.  Today a large proportion of internet traffic
  is email, comprising  millions of messages.

_____
<1.6> What is the future of identification on the internet?

  Some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images
  and voice messages  into mail and  will improve the sense of
  community that comes from the familiarity of identification.
  However, they are not currently widespread, require large amounts
  of data transfer, standardized software, and make some compromises
  in privacy.

  Promising new cryptographic techniques may make 'digital signatures'
  and 'digital authentication' common (see below).  Also, the trend
  in USENET standards is toward greater authentication of posted
  information.  On the other hand, advances in ensuring anonymity
  (such as remailers) are forthcoming.  See below.


PRIVACY
=======

_____
<2.1> What is `privacy' on the internet?

  Generally,  `privacy' has multiple connotations in society and
  perhaps even more on the internet, in cyberspace most take it to
  mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the
  data stored on and and directed to it (such as email), and you do
  not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches.  In other words, 
  others may obtain data associated with your account, but not
  without your permission.   ideas are probably both fairly
  limiting and liberal in  scope in what most internet users
  consider  private domains.  Some users  expect or want
  any privacy, some expect and demand it.

_____
<2.2> Why is privacy (un)important on the internet?

  This is a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic, arousing
  passionate opinions.  On the internet, some take privacy for
  granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent.
  Most governments have rules that protect privacy (such as the
  illegal search and seizure clause of the U.S. constitution, adopted
  by others) but have many that are antithetical to it (such as laws
  prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping). 
  rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules
  governing it.  However, the legal repercussions of the global
  internet are  largely unknown and untested (i.e. no strong
  legal precedents and  cases).  The fact that internet traffic
  frequently passes past international boundaries, and is not
  centrally managed, significantly complicates and strongly
  discourages its regulation.

_____
<2.3> How (in)secure are internet networks?

  - `Theoretically' people at any site in the chain of sites with
    access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the
    Internet  could potentially monitor or archive it. However, the
    sheer volume and general 'noise' inherent to this data makes
     scenarios highly improbable, even by government agencies
    with supposedly vast funding and resources.
  
  - Technologies exist to `tap' magnetic fields given off by
    electrical wires without detection.  Less obscurely, any machine
    with a network connection is a potential station for traffic
    detection, but this scenario requires knowledge and access to
    very low-level hardware (the network card) to pursue, if even
    possible.
  
  - A company Network General Inc. is one of many that manufactures
    and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can
    'filter' and read packets by arbitrary criteria for
    troubleshooting purposes, but the cost of this type of device is
    prohibitive for casual use.

  Known instances of the above types of security  breaches at a major
  scale (such as at network hubs) are very rare. The greatest risks
  tend to emerge locally.  Note that all  approaches are almost
  completely defused with the use of cryptography.
    
_____
<2.4> How (in)secure is my account?

  By default, not very.   are a multitude of factors that may
  reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet. 
  First, your account must be secure from other users. The universal
  system is to use a password, but if it is `weak' (i.e. easy to
  guess) this security is significantly diminished.  Somewhat
  surprisingly and frighteningly to some, certain  users of the
  system, particularly the administrator, generally have unlimited
  access regardless of passwords, and may grant that access to
  others.  This  that they may read any file in your account
  without detection.

  Furthermore, not universally known, most UNIX systems keep fairly
  extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in, what
  commands you execute, and when they are executed (in fact, login
  information is usually public). Most features of this `auditing' or
   `process accounting' information are enabled by default after the
  initial installation and the system administrator may customize it
  to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims. 
  This information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting
  purposes and may otherwise be ignored.  This data tracks
  unsuccessful login attempts and other 'suspicious' activities on
  the system. A traditional part of the UNIX system that tracks user
  commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of
  symbolic links (described  in 'man ln').
  
  UNIX implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features
  and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies
  regularly. Typically system adminstrators augment the basic UNIX
  functionality with public-domain programs and locally-developed
  tools for monitoring, and use them only to isolate `suspicious'
  activity as it arises (e.g. remote accesses to the 'passwd' file, incorrect
  login attempts, remote connection attempts, etc.).
  
  Generally, you  expect little privacy on your account for
  various reasons:
  
  - Potentially, every keystroke you type could be intercepted by
    someone else. 

  - System administrators make extensive backups that are completely
    invisible to users which may record the states of an account over
    many weeks. 

  - Erased files can, under many operating systems, be undeleted. 

  - Most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or
    otherwise; for example FTP sites usually log the commands and
    record the domain originations of users, including anonymous
    ones.

  - Some software exacerbates  problems.  See the section on
    ``X Windows (in)security''.

  Indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users, a much
  more commonly harmful threat.  are multiple ways to help
  ensure that your account will not be accessed by others, and
  compromises can often be traced to failures in  guide:

  - Choose a secure password.  Change it periodically.
  - Make sure to logout always.
  - Do not leave a machine unattended for long.
  - Make sure no one watches you when you type your password.
  - Avoid password  in email.
  - Be conservative in the use of the .rhost file.
  - Use utilities like `xlock' to protect a station, but be
    considerate.

  Be wary of situations where you  you  supply your
  password.   are only several basic situations where UNIX
  prompts you for a password: when you are logging in to a system or
  changing your password.  Situations can arise in which prompts for
  passwords are forged by other users, especially in cases where you
  are talking to them (such as Internet Relay Chat).  Also, be  aware
  that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain 
  passwords.

_____
<2.5> How (in)secure are my files and directories?

  The most important privacy considerations are related to file
  rights, and many lapses can be traced to  misunderstood nature
  or haphazard maintenance. Be aware of the rights associated with
  your files and directories in UNIX. If the `x' (`execute') right on
  your parent directory is off for users, groups, and other, 
  users cannot gain information on anything in your directories. 
  Anything less may allow others to read, change, or even delete
  files in your home directory. The rights on a directory supersede
  the rights associated with files in that directory. For a
  directory, 'x'  that access to the files (or subdirectories)
  in the directory is possible -- if you know  names.  To list
  the contents of the directory, however, requires the 'r' right.
 
  By default most accounts are accessable only to the owner, but the
  initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator
  perence.  The default file mode specifies the initial rights
  associated with newly created files, and can be set in the shell
  with `umask'.  The details of rights implementations tend to vary
  between versions of UNIX.  Consult man pages on `chmod' and `ls'.

  Examples
  --------

    traver.lance % ls -ld ~
    drwx------ 15 ld231782     1536 Jan 31 21:22 /users/ld231782/

  Here is a listing of the rights associated with a user's home
  directory, denoted by `~'.  The columns at the left identify what
  rights are available. The first column identifies the entry as a
  directory, and the next three columns mean that read, write, and
  execute rights, respectively, are permitted for that user.  For
  directories, the `x' right  that contents (file and
  subdirectory names) within that directory can be listed. The
  subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to
  anything in the directory tree originating at that point.  They
  can't even `see' any lower files or subdirectories; the hierarchy

  Here the modes on the file `msg' were changed to take away rights

  Note that `ls -l <file>' requires both the 'r' right to get the list
  of files and subdirectories, and the 'x' right to access the files
  and subdirectories in  to get  size, etc. For example,
  suppose the directory `foo' has rights dr--r--r--,  the following
  is possible:

    ls foo

   commands  fail independent of file rights:
  
    ls -l foo
    ls -l foo/file
    cat foo/file
    cd foo

  If the directory `foo' has rights d--x--x--x, the following are
  possible if it is known beforehand that `foo' contains an 'r'
  readable file named `file':
  
    ls -l foo/file
    cat foo/file
    cd foo
  
  The following commands fail:
  
    ls foo
    ls -l foo

<2.6> How (in)secure is X Windows?

  X Windows is the primary software developed by the MIT Athena
  project which is funded by U.S. government grants to develop
  applications to harness the power of networks in enhancing
  computational tasks, particularly the human-computer interface. 
  The software implements a client-server interface to a computer via
  graphical windows. In this case the `client' is the application
  requesting or utilizing  graphical resources (such as windows or a
  mouse) and the `server' is the machine that provides them.  In many
  situations the client is an application program running on the same
  machine as the server.

  The great utility of X Windows comes from its complete dissociation
  of the client and server so that windows may be `broadcast' to a
  server at a remote location from the  client. Unfortunately this
  dynamic power also introduces many deep, intricate, and complicated
  security considerations.  The primary security and privacy issue
  associated with X Windows is that much more sensitive data may be
  sent over a network, and over wider regions, than in the case where
  the human is situated near the host computer.  Currently  is
  no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in X
  Windows.

  Due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design
  flaws,  early versions of the X Window system are extremely
  insecure. Anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt
  that display or read it electronically based on access to the
  device unix:0.0 by any regular user.    are no protections
  from this type of access in  versions.   The problem arises
  because the security is completely based on machine addresses
  rather than users, such that any user at a `trusted' machine is
  himself trusted. Quoting from X documentation (man Xsecurity):
  
  > Any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed
  > access to the X server. This system can work reasonably well in
  > an environment where everyone trusts everyone, or when only a
  > single person can log into a given machine...This system does not
  > work well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and
  > mutual trust does not exist. 
  
  With the access control list, the `xhost' command may prevent some
  naive attempts (i.e.  other than the direct-access unix:0.0
  evasion); the syntax as typed on the host machine is  ``xhost
  +[name]'' where [name] is the domain name or internet address of an
  authorized client machine. By default clients running nonlocal to
  the host are disabled.  Public domain programs to disrupt a display
  momentarily (such as 'flip' or slowly mirror the screen image, or
  cause pixels to 'melt' down to the bottom) have been circulating on
  the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks
  on unsuspecting or inexperienced users.  Much more serious security
  breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this
  inherent weaknesses.  (The minimal, easily-bypassed `trusted'
  security mode of `xhost' has been jokingly erred to as ``X
  Hanging Open, Security Terrible.''). 

  New versions of the X Window system (X11R5 and higher) by default 
  make server access as secure as the file system using a .Xauthority
  file and 'magic cookies'.  Remote machines must have a code in the
  .Xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code
  allowed by the server.  Many older programs and even new
  vendor-supplied code does not support or is incompatible with
  `magic cookies'. The basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to
  monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of
  keys occurs in transmission.  X11R5 also includes other
  sophisticated encryption mechanisms.  Try `man Xsecurity' to find
  out what is supported at your site.  Even though improved security 
  mechanisms have been available in X Windows  ~1990, local
  sites often update this software infrequently because installation
  is extremely complex.

<2.7> How (in)secure is my email?

  By default, not very.  The characters that you are reading are
  almost certainly encoded in ASCII, the American Standard Code for
  Information Interchange that maps alphabetic and symbolic
  characters onto numeric codes and vice versa.  Virtually every
  computer system uses this code, and if not, has ways of converting
  to and from it.  When you write a mail message, by default it is
   sent in ASCII,  and  the standard is virtually
  universal,  is no intrinsic privacy.  Despite milleniums worth
  of accumulated cryptographic knowledge, cryptographic technologies
  are only recently  established that afford high priority to
  privacy as a primary criteria in computer and network design.  Some
  potential pitfalls in privacy are as follows:

  - The most serious threats are instances of immature or unscrupulous
    system operators reading private mail in the `spool files' at a
    local site (i.e. at the source or destination of the message),
    such as a . 
  
  - System administrators may also release files to law enforcement
    agencies, but conventions and protocols for warrants involving
    computer searches have  not been strongly established and
    tested legally.

  - Note that bounced messages go to postmasters at a given site in
     entirety.  This  that if you address mail with an
    incorrect address it has a good chance of  seen by a human
    other than the recipient.

  - Typically new user accounts are always set up such that the local
    mail directory is private, but this is not guaranteed and can be
    overridden.

  - Finally, be aware that some mailing lists (email addresses of 
    everyone on a list) are actually publicly accessable via mail 
    routing software mechanisms.  This `feature' can be disabled.

  Most potential compromises in email privacy can be thoroughly
  avoided with the use of strong end-to-end cryptography, which has
  its own set of caveats (for example, unscrupulous administrators
  may  be a threat if the encryption site is shared or
  nonlocal).  See the sections on ``email privacy'' and ``email
  policies.''

_____
<2.8> How am I (not) liable for my email and postings?

  As punishment or whatever, your system administrator can revoke
  certain `privileges' such as emailing, USENET posting or reading
  certain groups, file transferring, remote communications, or
  generally any subset of capabilities available from your account. 
  This all is completely at the discretion of the local administrator
  and under the procedures followed at a particular site, which in
  many cases are haphazard and crisis-oriented.  Currently  are
  virtually no widespread, uniform guide or procedures  for
  restricting use to any internet services, and local administrators
  are free to make arbitrary decisions on access.

  Today punitive measures are regularly applied in various situations.
  In the typical scenario complaint(s) reach a system adminstrator
  regarding abuses by a user, usually but not necessarily preceded by
  complaints to the user in email, regarding that person's
  objectionable email or postings.  `abusive' posters to USENET are
  usually first given admonitions from  system administrators as
  urged by others on the `net'. (The debate persists endlessly on
  many  whether this is also used  as a questionable 
  of attacking or silencing `harmless crackpots' or censoring
  unpopular opinions.)
  
  System administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to
  'squelch' severe cases of abuse.  In general, however, by tradition
  Usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of
  the system, but a colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe
   alternatives when this patience is sapped: the options
  wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next
  message (erred to as ``hitting the `n' key''), or to `plonk'
  annoying posters (according to the Hacker's Dictionary, the sound a
  jerk makes at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file).

  In cases where punitive actions are applied, generally system
  administrators are least likely to restrict email.  USENET postings
  are much more commonly restricted, either to individual users or 
  entire groups (such as a  campus).  Restrictions are most
  commonly associated with the following `abuses':

  - harassing or threatening notes, `email terrorism'
  - illegal uses, e.g. piracy or propagation of copyrighted material
  - `ad hominem' attacks, i.e. insulting the reputation of the
    poster instead of citing the content of the message
  - intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness
  - inappropriate postings, esp. binary files in regular groups
    `mail-bombing': inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive
    files

  Major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and
  official email or postings.  Most users have internet access via
  accounts at businesses or universities and  activities on the
  internet can be construed as representative of  parent
  s. Many people put disclaimers in  `signatures' in
  an attempt dissociate  identity and activities from parent
  s as a precaution. A recent visible political case
  involves the privacy of electronic mail  written by White House
  staff members of the Bush administration.  Following are some
  guide:

  - Acquaint yourself with your company or  policy.
  - If possible, avoid use of your company email address for private
    communication.
  - Use a disclaimer.
  - Keep a low profile (avoid `flamewars' or simply  post).
  - Avoid posting information that could be  construed to be
    proprietary or `internal'.

<2.9> How do I provide more/less information to others on my identity?

  The public information of your identity and account is mostly
  available though the UNIX utility `finger' described above. 
  
  - You have control over most of this information with the utility
    `chfn', the specifics vary between sites (on some systems use
    `passwd -f').
   
  - You can provide unlimited information in the .plan file which is
    copied directly to the destination during the fingering. 
    
  - A technique that works at some sites allows you to find out who is
    'finger'ing you and even to  vary the .plan file sent to them.
    
  - Your signature is determined by the environment variable SIGNATURE
    
  - USENET signatures are conventionally stored in the .signature file
    in your home directory.
    
  Providing less information on your online identity is more difficult
  and involved.  One approach is to ask your system adminstrator to
  change or delete information about you (such as your full name). 
  You may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from
  someone unrelated to you personally.  You may be able to remotely
  login (via modem or otherwise) to computers that you are not
  physically near.   are tactics for hiding or masking your
  online activities but nothing is foolproof.  Consult man pages on
  the 'chmod' command and the default file mode.  Generally, files on
  a shared system have good safeguards within the user pool but very
  little protection is possible from corrupt system administrators.

  To mask your identity in email or on USENET you can use different
  accounts. More untraceable are new `anonymous posting' and
  remailing services that are very recently  established.  See
  below.

______
<2.10> Who is my sysadmin?  What does s/he know about me?

  The requirements and screening for getting a system administration
  job (and by access to all information on a system) vary widely
  between sites and are sometimes frighteningly lax, especially at
  universities.  Many UNIX systems at universities are largely
  managed by undergraduates with a background in computing and often
  `hacking'.  In general, commercial and industrial sites are more
  strict on qualifications and background, and government sites are
  extremely strict.

  The system adminstrator (root user) can monitor what commands you
  used and at what times.  S/he may have a record (backups) of files
  on your account over a few weeks. S/he can monitor when  you send
  email or post USENET messages, and potentially read either.  S/he
  may have access to records indicating what hosts you are using,
  both locally and elsewhere.  Administrators sometimes employ
  specialized programs to  track `strange' or `unusual' activity,
  which can potentially be misused.

______
<2.11> Why is privacy (un)stable on the internet?

  For the numerous reasons listed above, privacy  not be an
  expectation with current use of the internet.  Furthermore, large
  parts of the internet are funded by the U.S. NSF (National Science
  Foundation) which places certain restrictions on its use (such as
  prohibiting commercial use).  Some high-level officials in this and
  other government agencies may be opposed to emerging techniques to
  guarantee privacy (such as encryption and anonymous services).

  Historically the major threats to privacy on the internet have been
  local. Perhaps the most common example of this are the widespread
  occurrences of  administrators using to carry some
  portion of USENET  labelled as `pornographic'. The
  `alternative' hierarchy in the USENET system, which has virtually
  no restrictions on propagation and new group creation, is
  frequently targeted (although this material may appear anywhere).

  From the global point of view traffic is generally completely
  unimpeded on the internet  and only the most egregious offenders
  are pursued.  For example,  verbatim transcriptions of copyrighted
  material (such as newspaper or magazine ) are posted to
  USENET with regularity without major consequences (some email
  complaints may ensue).  More astonishing to some is that currently
  significant portions of USENET traffic, and less so internet
  traffic, is comprised of sexually-explicit digitized images almost
  entirely originating from copyrighted material ( such as
  `alt.sex' regularly have the  highest traffic).
  
______
<2.12> What is the future of privacy on the internet?

  Some argue that the internet currently has an adequate or
  appropriate level of privacy.  Others will argue that as a
  prototype for future global networks it has woefully inadequate
  safeguards.  The internet is growing to become a completely global,
  international superhighway for data, and this traffic will
  inevitably entail data such as voice messages, postal mail, and
  many other items of extremely personal nature. Computer items that
  many people consider completely private (such as  local hard
  drives) will literally be inches from global network connections.
  Also, sensitive industrial and business information is exchanged
  over networks currently and this volume may conceivably merge with
  the internet.
  
  Most  agree that, for  basic but sensitive uses of the
  internet, no significant mechanisms are currently in place to
  ensure much privacy. New standards are calling for uniform
  introduction of `privacy enhanced mail' (PEM) which uses encryption
  technologies to ensure privacy, so that privacy protection is
  automatic, and may significantly improve safeguards.

  The same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy
  (such as with  surreptitious surveilance) can be overwhelmingly
  effective in protecting  it (e.g. with encryption). Some government
  agencies are opposed to unlimited privacy in general, and believe
  that it  lawfully be forfeited in cases of criminal conduct
  (e.g. -authorized wiretapping).  However, powerful new
  technologies to protect privacy on computers are becoming
  increasingly popular, provoking some to say that ``the cat is out
  of the bag'' and the ``genie can't be put back in the bottle''.  In
  less idiomatic terms, they believe that the spread of strong
  cryptography is already underway will be socially and technically
  unstoppable.
  
  To date, no feasible system that guarantees both secure
  communication and government oversight has been proposed (the two
  goals are largely incompatible). Proposals for ``registration'' of
  secret keys (by D. Denning on sci.crypt, for example) have been met
  with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at worst,
  mainly because of concerns for the right to privacy and objections
  of inherent feasibility.  Electronic privacy issues, and
  particularly the proper roles of networks and the internet, will
  foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few
  years.


ANONYMITY
=========

_____
<3.1> What is `anonymity' on the internet?

  Simply stated, anonymity is the absence of identity, the
  ultimate in privacy. However,  are several variations on
  this simple theme.  A person may wish to be consistently
  identified by a certain pseudonym or `handle' and establish a
  reputation under it in some area, providing pseudo-anonymity.
  A person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single
  one-way message (a sort of `hit-and-run'). Or, a person may
  wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with
  others (with either known or anonymous identities) via an
  `anonymous return address'.  A user may wish to appear as a
  `regular user' but actually be untraceable.  Sometimes a user
  wishes to hide who he is sending mail to (in addition to the
  message itself). The anonymous item itself may be directed at
  individuals or groups.  A user may wish to access some
  service and hide all  signs of the association. 
  
  All of  uses are feasible on the internet but are currently
  tricky to carry out in practice, because of all the tracking
  mechanisms inherent to operating systems and network protocols. 
  Officials of the NSF and other government agencies may be opposed
  to any of  uses because of the potential for abuse. 
  Nevertheless, the inherent facelessness of large networks will
  always guarantee a certain element of anonymity.

_____
<3.2> Why is `anonymity' (un)important on the internet?

  Anonymity is another powerful tool that can be beneficial or
  problematic depending on its use.  Arguably absence of
  identification is important as the presence of it.  It may be the
  case that many strong benefits from electronic anonymity will be
  discovered that were unforeseen and unpredicted, because true
  anonymity has been historically very difficult to establish.

  One can use anonymity to make personal statements to a colleague
  that  sabotage a relationship if stated openly (such as
  employer/employee scenarios).  One can use it to pass information
  and evade any threat of direct retribution.  For example,
  `whistleblowers' reporting on government abuses (economic, social,
  or  political) can bring issues to light without fear of stigma or
  retaliation. Sensitive, personal, potentially damaging information
  is often posted to some USENET groups, a risky situation where
  anonymity allows conversations to be carried on completely
  independent of the identities of the participants.  Some police
  departments run phone services that allow anonymous reporting of
  crimes; such uses  be straightforward on the network.
  Unfortunately, extortion and harassment become more insidious with
  assurances of anonymity.

_____
<3.3> How can anonymity be protected on the internet?

  The chief , as alluded to above, are masking identities in
  email and posting. However, anonymous accounts (public accounts as
  accessable and anonymous as e.g. public telephones) may be
  effective as well, but this use is generally not officially
  supported and even discouraged by some system adminstrators and NSF
  guide.  The nonuniformity in the requirements of obtaining
  accounts at different sites and institutions makes anonymous
  accounts generally difficult to obtain to the public at large.

  Many communications protocols are inherently detrimental to
  anonymity.  Virtually every protocol in existence currently
  contains information on both  and receiver in every packet.
  New communications protocols will likely develop that guarantee
  much higher degrees of secure anonymous communication.

_____
<3.4> What is `anonymous mail'?

  One approach to `anonymizing' mail has been to set up an `anonymous
  server' that, when activated by email to its address, responds by
  allocating and supplying an `anonymous ID' that is unique to the
  person requesting it (based on his email address).  This will vary
  for the same person for different machine address email
  originations. To send anonymous mail, the user sends email directed
  to the server containing the final destination. The server
  `anonymizes' the message by stripping of identification information
  and forwards the message, which appears to originate from the
  anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id. 
  This is the `interactive' use of anonymity or pseudonymity
  mentioned above.

  Another more `fringe' approach is to run a `cypherpunk' remailer
  from a regular user account (no root system privileges are
  required).  are currently  pioneered by  Eric Hughes and
  Hal Finney <hal@alumni.caltech.edu>. The operator runs a process on
  a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain
  characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail
  (typically fields in the header). One has been implemented as a 
  PERL script running on UNIX.  Several of  are in existence
  currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable;
  they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge.
  The remailers  generally support anonymous return addresses. 
  Mail that is incorrectly addressed is received by the operator. 
  Generally the user of the remailer has to disavow any
  responsibility for the messages forwarded through his system,
  although actually may be held liable regardless.

   approaches have several serious disadvantages and weaknesses:
  
  - The anonymous server approach requires maintaining a mapping of
    anonymous ID's to real addresses that must be maintained
    indefinitely.  One alternative is to allow `deallocation' of
    aliases at the request of the user, but this has not been
    implemented yet.

  - Although an unlikely scenario, traffic to any of  sites could
    conceivably be monitored from the `outside', necessitating the
    use of cryptography for basic protection,.

  - Local administrators can shut them down either out of caprice or
    under pressure from local, network, or government agencies.
  
  - Unscrupulous providers of the services can monitor the traffic
    that goes through them.

  - Most remailers currently keep logs that may be inspected. 

  - The cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because 
    operators are basically  network users who do not own the
    equipment and are accountable  to  own system
    administrators, who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic
    to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation is discovered,
    regarding it as illicit use. 

  - In all cases, a high degree of trust is placed in the anonymous
    server operator by the user.

  Currently the most direct route to anonymity involves using SMTP
  protocols to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary
  field information.  This practice, not uncommon to hackers, and the
  approach used by remailers, is generally viewed with hostility by
  most system administrators.  Information in the header routing data
  and logs of network port connection information may be retained
  that can be used to track the originating site.  In practice, this
  is generally infeasible and rarely carried out.  Some
  administrators on the network will contact local administrators to
  request a message be tracked and its writer admonished or punished
  more severely (such as revoking the account), all of this actually
  happening occasionally but infrequently.

  See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and 
  ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.

_____
<3.5> What is `anonymous posting'?

  Anonymous servers have been established as well for anonymous Usenet
  posting with all the associated caveats above (monitored traffic,
  capricious or risky local circumstances, logging).  Make sure to
  test the system at least once by e.g. anonymous posting to
  misc.test (however some operators  recommend this because many
  sites `autorespond' to test messages, possibly causing the
  anonymous server to allocate anonymous IDs for  machines). 
  See the ``responsibilties associated with anonymous posting''
  before proceeding.

  Another direct route involves using NNTP protocols to submit a
  message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information.
  This practice, not uncommon to hackers, is also generally viewed
  with hostility by most system administrators, and similar
  consequences can ensue.

  See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and 
  ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.

_____
<3.6> Why is anonymity (un)stable on the internet?

  As noted, many factors compromise the anonymity currently available
  to the general internet community, and  services  be
  used with great caution.  To summarize, the technology is in its
  infancy and current approaches are unined, unreliable, and not
  completely trustworthy.  No standards have been established and
  troubling situations of loss of anonymity and bugs in the software
  are prevalent.  Here are some encountered and potential bugs: 
  
  - One  anonymous remailer reallocated already allocated anonymous
    return addresses. 
  - Others passed signature information embedded in messages
    unaltered. 
  - Address resolution problems resulting in anonymized mail bounced
    to a remailer are common.
  - Forgeries to the anonymous server itself are a problem,  possibly
    allowing unauthorized users to potentially glean anon ID - email
    address  mappings in the alias file.  This can be remedied with
    the use of passwords.
  - Infinite mail loops are possible with chaining remailers.
  
  Source code is  distributed, tested, and ined for 
  systems, but standards are progressing slowly and weakly.  The
  field is not likely to improve considerably without  official
  endorsement and action by network agencies.  The whole idea is
  essentially  in its infancy and viewed with suspicion and
  distrust by many on the internet, seen as illegitimate or favorable
  to criminality.  The major objection to anonymity over regular
  internet use  is the perceived lack of accountability to system
  operators, i.e. invulnerability to account restrictions resulting
  from outside complaints.  System adminstrators at some sites have
  threatened to filter anonymous news postings generated by the
  prominent servers from  re flows.  This may only
  have the effect of encouraging server operators to create less
  characteristically detectable headers.  Probably the least
  problematic approach, and the most traditional to Usenet, is for
  individual users to deal with anonymous mail however they per,
  e.g. ignoring it or filtering it with kill files.
  
_____
<3.7> What is the future of anonymity on the internet?

  New anonymous protocols effectively serve to significantly increase
  safeguards of anonymity.  For example, the same mechanism that
  routes email over multiple hosts, by threatening its privacy,
  can also be used to guarantee it. In a scheme called `chaining' an
  anonymous message is passed through multiple anonymous servers
  before reaching a destination.  In this way generally multiple
  links of the chain have to be `broken' for security to be
  compromised. Re-encryption at each link makes this scenario even
  more unlikely.  Even more significantly the anonymous remailers
  could be spread over the internet globally so that local weaknesses
  (such as corrupt governments or legal wiretapping within a nation)
   be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message
  tracing. However, remailers run by corrupt operators are possible.
  
  The future of anonymous services on the internet is, at this time,
  highly uncertain and fraught with peril.  specific groups seem
  to benefit significantly from anonymous posting capabilities, many
  feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous posting is a
  disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussions in
  `serious' groups.   The introduction of unlimited group anonymity
  may have fundamental repercussions on Usenet conventions and
   mechanisms such as moderated and `alt' groups have had
  in the past. For example, as part of new group creation, the
  charter may specify whether `anonymous' posting is (un)welcome. 

  Nevertheless, the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may
  be inevitable. Based on traffic statistics, anonymous services are
  in huge demand. Pervasive and readily available anonymity could
  carry significant and unforeseen social consequences.  However, if
  its use is continued to be generally regarded as subversive it may
  be confined to the underground.  The ramifications of widespread
  introduction of anonymity to Usenet are  largely unknown. It
  is unclear whether it will provoke signficant amounts of new
  traffic or, instead of expansion, cause a shift where a greater
  portion of existing traffic is anonymized.  Conceivably the
  services could play a role in influencing future mainstream social
  acceptance of Usenet.

<4.1> What UNIX programs are related to privacy?

  For more information, type `man [cmd]' or `apropos [keyword]' at the
  UNIX shell prompt.

    passwd - change password
    finger - obtain information about a remote user
    chfn   - change information about yourself obtainable by remote
             users (sometimes `passwd -f')
    chmod  - change the rights associated with a file or directory
    umask  - (shell) change the default (on creation) file access
             rights
    ls     - list the rights associated with files and directories
    xhost  - allow or disable access control of particular users to an
             Xwindow server
    last   - list the latest user logins on the system and 
             originations
    who    - list other users, login/idle times, originations
    w      - list other users and what they are running
    xhost  - access control list for X Window client use
    xauth  - control X Window server authentication
    
    .signature  - file in the home directory appended to USENET posts
    .forward    - file used to forward email to other accounts
    .Xauthority - file used for X Window server authentication keys
    $SIGNATURE  - variable used for name in email and USENET postings

  The 'tcpdump' packet-tracing program is loosely based on SMI's
  "etherfind" although none of the etherfind code remains.  It was
  originally written by Van Jacobson, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory,
  as part of an ongoing research project to investigate and improve
  tcp and internet gateway performance.  A current version is
  available via anonymous ftp from host ftp.ee.lbl.gov (currently at
  address 128.3.254.68) file tcpdump.tar.Z (a compressed Unix tar
  file). This program is  to  the 'standard' Berkeley network
  software copyright.

_____
<4.2> How can I learn about or use cryptography?

  A general introduction to mostly theoretical cryptographic issues,
  especially  frequently discussed in sci.crypt, is available
  in FAQ form:

  >  Compiled by:
  >        cme@ellisun.sw.stratus.com (Carl Ellison)
  >        Gwyn@BRL.MIL (Doug Gwyn)
  >        smb@ulysses.att.com (Steven Bellovin)

  NIST (U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology)
  publishes an introductory paper on cryptography, special
  publication 800-2 ``Public-Key Cryptograhy'' by James Nechvatal
  (April 1991).  Available via anonymous FTP from
  csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (129.6.54.11), file pub/nistpubs/800-2.txt. 
  Also via available anonymous FTP from wimsey.bc.ca as crypt.txt.Z
  in the crypto directory.  Covers technical mathematical aspects
  of encryption such as number theory.

  More general information can be found in a FAQ by Paul Fahn of RSA
  Labortories via anonymous FTP from rsa.com in /pub/faq.ps.Z.  See
  the `readme' file for information on the `tex' version.  Also
  available as hardcopy for $20 from   RSA Laboratories, 100 Marine
  Parkway, Redwood City, CA  94065.  Send questions to
  faq-editor@rsa.com.

  Phil Zimmerman's PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) public-domain package
  for public key encryption is available at numerous sites, and is
  in widespread use over the internet for general UNIX-based file
  encryption (including email).  Consult the archie FTP database. 
  Also see the newsgroup alt.security.pgp.  Mailing list requests
  to info-pgp-request@lucpul.it.luc.edu.

  From the  FAQ by Marc VanHeyningen
  <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu> on news.answers:

  >  is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM)
  > using the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows
  > your electronic mail to have the properties of authentication
  > (i.e. who sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can
  > read it except the intended recipient.)
  > 
  >  was written primarily by Mark Riordan
  > <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>. Most of the code is in the public domain,
  > except for the RSA routines, which are a library called RSA
  > licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.
  > 
  >  is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent
  > residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsa/ and read the
  > README file for info.
  > 
  > , as well as some other crypt stuff, has its `home site' on
  > rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in
  > the U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To
  > find out how to obtain access, ftp , cd to pub/crypt/, and
  > read the file GETTING_ACCESS.

  Note: cryptography is generally not well integrated into email yet
  and some system proficiency is required by users to utilize it.

_____
<4.3> What is the cypherpunks mailing list?

  Eric Hughes <hughes@toad.com> runs the `cypherpunk' mailing list
  dedicated to ``discussion about technological defenses for privacy
  in the digital domain.''  Send email to
  cypherpunks-request@toad.com to be added or subtracted from the
  list. From the charter:

  > The most important  to the defense of privacy is encryption.
  > To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy.  But to encrypt
  > with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for
  > privacy. Cypherpunks hope that all people desiring privacy will
  > learn how best to defend it.

<4.7> How can I run an anonymous remailer?

  Cypherpunk remailer source is at soda.berkeley.edu in the
  /pub/cypherpunks directory.  It's written in PERL, and is
  relatively easy to install (no administrative rights are required).
  Karl Barrus  <elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu> has more information and
  modifications. Also, most remailer operators mentioned above are
  amenable to discussing features, problems, and helping new sites
  become operational. Address all points in the section
  ``responsibities of anonymous use'' in this document prior to
  advertising your service.  You  be committed to the long-term
  stability of the site and avoid running one surreptitiously.

<5.1> What is ``digital cash''?

  With digital encryption and authentication technologies, the
  possibility of a widespread digital cash system may someday be
  realized.  A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks
  (similar to today's checking system except entirely digital) may
  be one approach.  The issues of cryptography, privacy, and
  anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an
  economy.  See the  in Scientific American by  Chaum
  (~Dec.1992).

  An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus
  <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU> based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the
  cypherpunks mailing list.  To use the server send mail to
  elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text:

    ::
    command: help
    
    user@host

  where `user@host' is your email address.
 
  
_____
<5.2> What is a ``hacker'' or ``cracker''?

   terms arouse strong feelings by many on  meaning,
  especially on the internet.  In the general news media in the past
  a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as
  breaking into systems) has been erred to as a hacker, but most
  internet users per the term ``cracker'' for this.  Instead, a
  ``hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious,
  curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a
  system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and
  patriot.  This is the sense intended in this document.  See also
  the ``Hacker's Dictionary'' and the FAQ `alt-security-faq'.
 
 
_____
<5.3> What is a ``cypherpunk''?

  From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:

  > Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish  were
  > more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that  who want privacy
  > must create it for themselves and not expect governments,
  > corporations, or other large, faceless s to grant
  > them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people
  > have been creating  own privacy for centuries with whispers,
  > envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek
  > to prevent other people from speaking about  experiences or
  >  opinions.

  See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below.

  See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary
  in soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks.

_____
<5.4> What is `steganography' and anonymous pools?

  Closely associated with encryption is `steganography' or the
  techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication
  but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself. 
  Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the
  proliferation of computer technology.  For example, it is possible
  to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,
  typically the most 'noisy'. In addition, when such an item is
  posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually
  untraceable  communication can take place between  and
  receiver.  For  steganographic communications in the electronic
  realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where
  individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual
  users decode particular messages with  unique key.   An
  anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman
  (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  Send email to
  <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com>  with one of the following
  commands in the  line:

    subscribe
    unsubscribe
    help

_____
<5.5> What is `security through obscurity'?

  `Security through obscurity' ers to the attempt to gain
  protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information
  or programs relating to them.  For example, a company may not make
  public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade
  `attacks' based on knowledge of it. Another example  be
  concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in
  operating systems.  Or, some reliance may be made on the fact that
  some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious
  because they are ``not widely known'' or ``not widely used.'' This
  argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet
  posting `forgery'. `Security through obscurity' is regarded as a
  very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at
  worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach''). See the FAQ
  for alt.security.  
  
  Some remarks of John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic
  Frontier Foundation, directed to NSA agents at the First
  International Symposium on National Security & National
  Competitiveness held in McLean, Virginia  Dec. 1, 1992:

  > Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep
  > contained. ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  It's
  > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  If
  > something hits the Net and it's something which people on 
  > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.  I
  > believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into
  > an environment where any information which is at all interesting
  > to people is going to get out.  And  will be very little
  > that you can do about it.  This is not a bad thing in my view,
  > but you may differ...

_____
<5.6> What are `identity daemons'?
  
  RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to
  query a remote user's login name after connection to a local
  communication socket (a connection of this type is established
  during FTP and TELNET sessions, for example).  The standard is not
  widely supported, perhaps 10% of internet sites currently implement
  it but the number is increasing.  The mechanism is detrimental to
  anonymity.  Regular users cannot disable it but system
  adminstrators can circumvent it.  This standard may represent a
  trend toward greater authentication mechanisms.

_____
<5.7> What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy?


  Remailing/Posting
  -----------------
  
  - Stable, secure, protected, officially sanctioned and permitted,
    publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs.
  - Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET
    postings.
  - Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information
    obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms (chaining,
    encrypted addresses, etc.)
  - Standards for anonymous email addressing, embedding files, and
    remailer site chaining.
  
  General
  -------
  
  - Recognition of anonymity, cryptography, and related privacy
    shields as legitimate, useful, desirable, and crucial by the
    general public and  governments.
  - Widespread use and implementation of  technologies 
    by systems designers into
    hardware, software, and standards, implemented `securely,'
    `seamlessly,' and `transparently'.
  - General shift of use, dependence, and reliance to  other than
    wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement
    agencies.
  - Publicity, retraction, and dissolution of laws and government
    agencies opposed to privacy, replaced by structures dedicated to
    strengthening and protecting it.

  From ftp.eff.org:/pub/EFF/mission_statement:

  > A new world is arising in the vast web of digital, electronic
  > media which connect us.  Computer-based communication media like
  > electronic mail and computer conferencing are becoming the basis
  > of new forms of community.   communities without a single,
  > fixed geographical location comprise the first settlements on an
  > electronic frontier.
  > 
  >  well-established legal principles and cultural norms give
  > structure and coherence to uses of conventional media like
  > newspapers, books, and telephones, the new digital media do not
  > so easily fit into existing frameworks.  Conflicts come about as
  > the law struggles to define its application in a context where
  > fundamental notions of speech, property, and place take
  > profoundly new forms. People sense both the promise and the
  > threat inherent in new computer and communications technologies,
  > even as they struggle to master or simply cope with them in the
  > workplace and the home.
  > 
  > The Electronic Frontier Foundation has been established to help
  > civilize the electronic frontier; to make it truly useful and
  > beneficial not just to a technical elite, but to everyone; and to
  > do this in a way which is in keeping with our society's highest
  > traditions of the free and open flow of information and
  > communication.
  
  EFF was started by the multimillionaire Mitchell Kapor, founder of
  Lotus software, and John Barlow, lyricist for the Grateful Dead
  rock band.  A highly publicized endeavor of the 
  involved the legal defense of  Steve Jackson Games after an FBI
  raid and an accompanying civil suit  (see section on ``Steve
  Jackson Games'').  The foundation publishes EFF News (EFFector
  Online) electronically, send requests to effnews-request@eff.org.
  
  In a letter to Mitchell Kapor from the Chairman of the Subcommittee
  with primary jurisdiction over telecommunications policy dated
  November 5, 1991,  Representative  Edward J. Markey complemented
  Mitchell Kapor on his ``insights on the development of a national
  public information infrastructure'' which ``were appreciated greatly
  by myself and the Members of the Subcommittee'' (complete text in 
  ftp.eff.com:/pub/pub-infra/1991-12):

  > ...we need to pursue policies that encourage the Bell companies to
  > work with other sectors of the communications industry to create
  > a consumer-oriented, public information network. Please let me or
  > my staff know what policies you and others in the computer
  > industry believe  best serve the public interest in creating
  > a reasonably priced, widely available network in which
  > competition is open and innovation rewarded.  I also want to
  > learn what lessons from the computer industry over the past ten
  > to fifteen years  apply to the current debate on
  > structuring the information and communications networks of the
  > future....I ask your help in gaining input from the computer
  > industry so that the Subcommittee can shape policies that will
  > bring this spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship to the
  > information services industry.

<6.2> Who are Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR)?

  The Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility have been
  working to protect and promote electronic civil liberties issues
   ~1982.  The group has three offices (Palo Alto, Cambridge,
  Washington, DC) and 20 chapters. It is involved in  litigation
  against the FBI, The NSA, NIST, the Secret Service and other other
  U.S. government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation
  on issues such as Operation Sundevil, the FBI wiretap proposal,
  NSA's interference in crypography, the breakup of the 2600 raid in
  Arlington, Va in Nov 1992. Members speak frequently in front on
  Congress, state legislators and public utility commissions to
  testify on privacy, information policy, computer security, and
  caller identification.

  CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available
  via FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and email at cpsr.org, currently comprising
  the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet.  For
  more information, anonymous FTP  cpsr.org:/cpsr/.

<6.3> What was `Operation Sundevil' and the Steve Jackson Game case?

  In the early 1990's a fear spread among U.S. law enforcement agencies
  on the illicit activities of `hackers' and `phreakers' involved in
  such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery.
  
  (see ftp.eff.org:/pub/SJG/General_Information/EFFector1.04):

  > `Operation Sundevil,' the Phoenix-inspired crackdown of May
  > 8,1990, concentrated on telephone code-fraud and credit-card
  > abuse, and followed this seizure plan with some success. 
  > [Bulletin Board Systems] went down all over America, terrifying
  > the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of
  >  criminal instruments.  It also saddled analysts with some
  > 24,000 floppy disks, and confronted harried Justice Department
  > prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide
  > hacker show-trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of
  > jurisdictions.

  Massive `show-trials' never materialized, although isolated
  instances of prosecution were pursued.  The movement reached a
  crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal
  search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of
  Austin Texas on March 1, 1990.  From the column GURPS' LABOUR LOST
  by Bruce Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> in Fantasy and Science
  Fiction Magazine:

  > In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional
  > warrant, agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the
  > SJG office.  When they left they took a manuscript  prepared
  > for publication, private electronic mail, and several computers,
  > including the hardware and software of the SJG Computer Bulletin
  > Board System.  Yet Jackson and his business were not only
  > innocent of any crime, but never suspects in the first place. 
  > The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that
  > somewhere in Jackson's office  `might be' a document
  > compromising the security of the 911 telephone system.

  FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed
  on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier
  Foundation.  See information on EFF below.  From an  by Joe
  Abernathy in the Houston Chronicle ~Feb 1, 1993:
  
  > AUSTIN -- An electronic civil rights case against the Secret
  > Service closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal
  > District Judge Sam Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a
  > proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown,
  > and went too far in retaining  custody of seized equipment. 
  > 
  > Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago, who was in
  > charge of three Austin computer search-and-seizures on March 1,
  > 1990, that led to the lawsuit, stoically endured Spark's rebuke
  > over the Service's poor investigation and abusive computer
  > seizure policies.   the Service has seized dozens of
  > computers  the crackdown began in 1990, this is the first
  > case to challenge the practice. 
  > 
  > Sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the Austin
  > science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never
  > suspected of a crime, and that agents did not do even marginal
  > research to establish a criminal connection between the firm and
  > the suspected illegal activities of an employee, or to determine
  > that the company was a publisher. Indeed, agents testified that
  > they were not even trained in the Privacy Protection Act at the
  > special Secret Service school on computer crime. 
  > 
  > "How long  it have taken you, Mr. Foley, to find out what
  > Steve Jackson Games did, what it was?" asked Sparks. "An hour? 
  > 
  > "Was  any reason why, on March 2, you could not return to
  > Steve Jackson Games a copy, in floppy disk form, of everything
  > taken? 
  > 
  > "Did you read the  in Business Week magazine where it had
  > a picture of Steve Jackson -- a law-abiding, tax-paying citizen
  > -- saying he was a computer crime suspect? 
  > 
  > "Did it ever occur to you, Mr. Foley, that seizing this material
  > could harm Steve Jackson economically?" 
  > 
  > Foley replied, "No, sir," but the judge offered his own answer. 
  > 
  > "You actually did, you just had no idea anybody  actually go
  > out and hire a lawyer and sue you." 
  > 
  > More than $200,000 has been spent by the Electronic Frontier 
  > Foundation in bringing the case to trial. The EFF was founded by 
  > Mitchell Kapor amid a civil liberties movement sparked in large
  > part by the Secret Service computer crime crackdown.

<6.4> What is Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)?

  ISDN is a high-speed data communications standard that utilizes
  existing copper telephone , and is a possible inexpensive and
  intermediate alternative to laying fiber optic cable for phone
  networks.  The speeds involved may be sufficient for audio and
  video transmission applications.  G. V. der Leun in the file
  ftp.eff.org: /pub/pub-infra/1991-11:

  > Telecommunications in the United States is at a crossroads.  With
  > the Regional Bell Operating Companies now free to provide
  > content, the shape of the information networking is about to be
  > irrevocably altered.  But will that network be the open,
  > accessible, affordable network that the American public needs? 
  > You can help decide this question.
  > 
  > The Electronic Frontier Foundation recently presented a plan to
  > Congress calling for the immediate deployment of a national
  > network based on existing ISDN technology, accessible to anyone
  > with a telephone connection, and priced like local voice service.
  >  We believe deployment of such a platform will spur the
  > development of innovative new information services, and maximize
  > freedom, competitiveness, and civil liberties throughout the
  > nation.
  > 
  > The EFF is testifying before Congress and the FCC; making
  > presentations to public utility commisions from Massachusetts to
  > California; and meeting with representatives from telephone
  > companies, publishers, consumer advocates, and other stakeholders
  > in the telecommunications policy debate.
  > 
  > The EFF believes that participants on the Internet, as pioneers on
  > the electronic frontier, need to have  voices heard at this
  > critical moment.

<6.6> What is the FBI's proposed Digital Telephony Act?

  ``Providers of electronic communication services and private branch
  exchange operators shall provide within the United States
  capability and capacity for the government to intercept wire and
  electronic communications when authorized by law...''
  
  From `BBS Legislative Watch: FBIs Wiretapping Proposal Thwarted' by
  S. Steele in Boardwatch Magazine, Feb. 1993, p. 19-22:
 
  > In a move that worried privacy experts, software manufacturers and
  > telephone companies, the FBI proposed legislation to amend the
  > Communications Act of 1934 to make it easier for the Bureau to
  > perform electronic wiretapping. The proposed legislation,
  > entitled 'Digital Telephony,'  have required communications
  > service providers and hardware manufacturers to make 
  > systems 'tappable' by providing 'back doors' through which law
  > enforcement officers could intercept communications. Furthermore,
  > this capability  have been provided undetectably,  the
  > communications was in progress, exclusive of any communications
  > between other parties, regardless of the mobility of the target
  > of the FBI's investigation, and without degradation of service.
  >  
  > ...under the proposal, the Department of Justice (DOJ) can keep
  > communications products off the market if it determines that
  >  products do not meet the DOJ's own ... guide. This
  > [could] result in increased costs and reduced competitiveness for
  > service providers and equipment manufacturers,  they will be

  > of  entire product. ...the FBI proposal suggests that the
  > cost of this wiretapping 'service' to the Bureau  have to be
  > borne by the service provider itself...
  > 
  > The Electronic Frontier Foundation organized a broad coalition of
  > public interest and industry groups, from Computer Professionals

  > Microsystems, to oppose the legislation. A white paper produced
  > by the EFF and ratified by the coalition, entitled, `An Analysis

  > throughout the Congress.  ... The Justice Department lobbied hard
  > in the final days to get Congress to take up the bill before

<7.1> What is the background behind the Internet?
 
  The  ``Internet'' in Fantasy and Science Fiction by Bruce
  Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> contains general and nontechnical
  introductory notes on origins of the Internet, including the role
  of the RAND corporation, the goal of network resilience in face of
  nuclear attack, MIT, UCLA, ARPANET, TCP/IP, NSF, NREN, etc.:

  > ARPANET itself formally expired in 1989, a happy victim of its 
  > own overwhelming success.  Its users scarcely noticed, for
  > ARPANET's  functions not only continued but steadily improved. 
  > The use of  TCP/IP standards for computer networking is now
  > global.  In 1971, a  mere twenty-one years ago,  were only
  > four nodes in the  ARPANET  network.  Today  are tens of
  > thousands of  nodes in  the Internet,  scattered over forty-two
  > countries, with more coming  on-line every day.   Three million,
  > possibly four million people use  this gigantic
  > mother-of-all-computer-networks.   
  > 
  > The Internet is especially popular among scientists, and is 
  > probably the most important scientific instrument of the late 
  > twentieth century.   The  powerful, sophisticated access that it 
  > provides to specialized data and personal communication  has sped
  > up the pace of scientific research enormously.  
  > 
  > The Internet's pace of growth in the early 1990s is  spectacular, 
  > almost ferocious.  It is spreading faster than cellular phones,
  > faster  than fax machines.  Last year the Internet was growing at
  > a rate of  twenty percent a *month.*  The number of `host'
  > machines with direct  connection to TCP/IP has been doubling
  > every year   1988.   The Internet is moving out of  its
  > original base in military and  research institutions,  into
  > elementary and high schools, as well as into  public libraries
  > and the commercial sector.

<8.1> What are some known anonymous remailing and posting sites?

  Currently the most stable of anonymous remailing and posting sites
  is anon.penet.fi operated by julf@penet.fi for several months, who
  has system adminstrator privileges and owns the equipment. 
  Including anonymized mail, Usenet posting, and return addresses 
  (no encryption).  Send mail to help@penet.fi for information.
 
  Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk
  remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu (128.32.149.19):
  pub/cypherpunks/hal's.instructions. See also scripts.tar.Z (UNIX
  scripts to aid remailer use) and anonmail.arj (MSDOS batch files to
  aid remailer use).

  ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu
  -----------------------------
    Anonymized mail.  Request information from above address.
    
  elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu
  -------------------------
    Experimental anonymous remailer run Karl Barrus
    <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU>, with encryption to the server.  Request
    information from that address.
    
  hal@alumni.caltech.edu
  ----------------------
    Experimental remailer with encryption to server and return
    addresses.  Request information from above address.

  hh@soda.berkeley.edu
  hh@cicada.berkeley.edu
  hh@pmantis.berkeley.edu
  ----------------------
    Experimental remailer.  Include header `Request-Remailing-To'.

  nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu 
  ----------------------
    Experimental remailer allowing one level of chaining.  Run by
    Chael Hall.  Request information from above address.

  phantom@mead.u.washington.edu 
  -----------------------------
    Experimental remailer with encryption to server.  `finger' site
    address for information.

  Notes
  =====
  
  - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often
    running without site administrator knowledge. Liability issues
    are wholly unresolved.
  
  - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP
    software (see the question on cryptography). 

  - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)
    vary between sites.

  - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are
    mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time.

_____
<8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?

  
  Users
  -----

  - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the
    seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.
  - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.
  - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on
    Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular .
  - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.
    Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases
    network traffic.
  - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this
    is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt'
    hierarchy is perred.
  - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.
    , etc.) Remember that content is the only  for
    readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any
    inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even
    future ones under the same handle.
  - Be caul not to include information that will reveal your
    identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by
    sending anonymized mail to yourself.
  - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them. 
    Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.
  - Be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity.
  - ``Hit-and-run'' anonymity  be used with utmost reservation.
    Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.
  - Be eous to the system operator, who may have invested large
    amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating
    his hardware, all for your convenience.

  Operators
  ---------

  - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an
    introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and
    consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and
    monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and
    security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or
    lassaiz-faire?
  - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate
    potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user
    is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user
    posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember, your
    users trust you to protect them.
  - In the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations
    where you will take action and what  actions will be (e.g.
    warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke
    the account, 'out' the user, contact local administrator, etc.)
  - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware.
    Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly
    and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with
    users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under
    ``(in)stability of anonymity''.
  - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running?
    What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is
    your commitment to it?
  - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an
    address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item. 
    Consult a lawyer about your liability.
  - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared
    to deal with complaints and `hate mail' addressed to you.  If you
    do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system
    adminstrator, consult  who do and are.
  - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If
    possible, query group readers.
  - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message
    format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure
    the key text `Anon' is  somewhere in every header.
  - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from
    physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations.

  Readers
  -------
  
  - Do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason
    that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that
    equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail
    anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its
    volume is heavy or increasing).
  - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.  Abusive posters
    will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate
    responses.  Sometimes the most effective response is silence.
  - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy,
    harassment, extortion, etc.
  - Do not complain about postings  inappropriate because they
    offend you personally.
  - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the
    idea of anonymity itself.
  - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings
     be barred from particular groups because no `possible' or
    `conceivable' need exists.

_____
<8.3> How do I `kill' anonymous postings?

  James Thomas Green <jgreen@zeus.calpoly.edu>:

  > Try putting this in your kill file:
  >   
  >   /Anon/h:j
  >   /Anonymous/h:j
  > 
  > This will search the headers of the messages and kill any that
  > contain `Anon' or `Anonymous' in them.  Not perfect and won't
  > kill followups. 
  
  Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask
  anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so
  far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common
  as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering.
  
_____
<8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers?

  Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for
  individual, particularly volatile , where anonymity is
  almost the perred method of communication, such as talk.abortion
  and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack
  started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was
  wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises)
  but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided
  anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up
  the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous
  alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through
  servers like 's no tomorrow.''
  
  Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax' and interested in
  researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste
  <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system
  from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the
  server to new, more `mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge,
  and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by
  multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended
  advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group
  support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was
  arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.'' 
  K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an
  anonymous service  be welcome , and judged a consensus
  against it. 

  K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to
  `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and
  used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of
  intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his
  server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was ed to
  abuses to the point where it was ed dismantled by the
  facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was
  created.''

  In ~Nov 1992, Johan Helsingius (julf@penet.FI) set up the most
  controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on
  scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized
  mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine
  the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide
  accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests.
  
  J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet
  newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological
  opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy).
  Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium,
  abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than
  ``routine'' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of
  anonymity is also controversial.

  For example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb
  1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate
  crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via
  anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been
  posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then
  non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a
  New York news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of
  vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity, reverberating
  through many . 
  
  The original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded
  that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,''
  suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was
  not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of
  the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived
  association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries
  for the original  by late-entering readers. The anonymous
  user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his
  detractors.

  Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal
  opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news
  operators, J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire
  extingisher'' and the ``group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the
  scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is
  best described as `inundated': it has registered over 13,000 users
  in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a
  day, and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized
  through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due
  to the capability for `global' anonymity which has allowed users to
  find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.

  Johan Helsingius has been  to extraordinary pressure to
  dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste
  threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate
  news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages
  originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to
  threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several
  times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing' through it
  by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5
  hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the
  service's administration. In response to the serious threats he
  disabled global group access temporarily for one week and
  encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.
  
  Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by
  ``cypherpunks,'' J. Helsingius has identified many security
  weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is
  currently in the process of code development and testing. He is
  planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon
  to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new
  system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple
  email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption,
  etc.

  A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec.
  1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography
  in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of
  confidentiality seen so far.  However, it was running on a public
  access account, and he had to shut it down after only several
  weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately
  originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the
  software to the public domain.

  Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing' on
  government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and
  group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the
  group  allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers,
  and even establish reputations based on  authentifiable
  digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in
  the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to
  attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing
  easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and
  encryption.

  is going on with anon.penet.fi?'' in this document.

It has actually come up (or it will in a week or two) in NZ.  I'll post the
outcome when the trial finishes (which could take months BTW).  Overall it
looks like you can't be forced to reveal a password, if anyone can provide
a convincing legal argument to the contrary (ie an actual  case) I'd

                 Network and Distributed System Security

        3-4 February 1994, Catamaran Hotel, San Diego, California

The symposium will bring together people who are building software and
hardware to provide network or distributed system security services.
The symposium is intended for  interested in practical aspects of
network and distributed system security, rather than in theory.  Symposium
proceedings will be published by the Internet Society.  Topics for the
symposium include, but are not limited to, the following:

*  Design and implementation of services--access control, authentication,
   availability, confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation
   --including criteria for placing services at particular protocol
layers.

*  Design and implementation of security mechanisms and support
   services--encipherment and key management systems, authorization
   and audit systems, and intrusion detection systems.

*  Requirements and architectures for distributed applications and
   network functions--message handling, file transport, remote
   file access, directories, time synchronization, interactive
   sessions, remote data base management and access, routing, voice and
   video multicast and conferencing, news groups, network management,
   boot services, mobile computing, and remote I/O.

*  Special issues and problems in security architecture, such as
   -- very large systems like the international Internet, and
   -- high-speed systems like the gigabit testbeds now  built.

*  Interplay between security goals and other goals--efficiency,
   reliability, interoperability, resource sharing, and low cost.

        But that's just the problem.  is no such thing as
        "MIME-Formatted". By analogy, MIME is a content-labelling
        standard for the box, not a specification for the contents
        themselves. It provides a standard for "like-minded"
        individuals to exchange mail containing an agreed-upon data
        format.

                         THE WHITE HOUSE

                  Office of the Press Secretary

_________________________________________________________________

For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993


                STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY


The President today announced a new initiative that will bring
the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary
program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
communications  meeting the legitimate needs of law
enforcement.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.

For too long  has been little or no dialogue between our
private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the
tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of
protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate
the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and
law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against
industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.

Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to
protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now  used to
protect electronic mail and computer files.   encryption
technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the
unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used
by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.

A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the " Chip" has
been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a
new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,
relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to
an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications
using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in
commercial use today.

This new technology will help companies protect proprietary
information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the
ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to
intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. 

A "key-" system will be established to ensure that the
" Chip" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding
Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique


                                2


"keys," numbers that will be needed by authorized government
agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the
device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately
in two "key-" data bases that will be established by the
Attorney General.  Access to  keys will be limited to
government officials with legal authorization to conduct a
wiretap.

The " Chip" technology provides law enforcement with no
new authorities to access the content of the private
conversations of Americans.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the
Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new
devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the
government will be offered access to the confidential details of
the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
 findings.

The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of
encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the
privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield
criminals and terrorists.  We need the " Chip" and other
approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access
to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it
to hide  illegal activities.  In  to assess technology
trends and explore new approaches (like the key- system),
the President has directed government agencies to develop a
comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:

     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to
          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;

     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone
          calls and data, under proper  or other legal
          , when necessary to protect our citizens;

     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern
          technology to build the National Information
          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and
          the competitiveness of American industry in the global
          marketplace; and 

     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export
          high technology products.

The President has directed early and frequent consultations with
affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the
privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.



                                3

The Administration is committed to working with the private
sector to spur the development of a National Information
Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer
technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to
information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks
("information superhighways") will transmit video, images, HDTV
programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone
system transmits voice.

 encryption technology will play an increasingly important
role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act
quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding
its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that
protect all Americans' right to privacy  also protecting
them from  who break the law.

Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. 
The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new
encryption technology are also available.

Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.

---------------------------------


QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE




Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government
     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?

A:   No.  " Chip" technology provides law enforcement with
     no new authorities to access the content of the private
     conversations of Americans.

Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
     encrypted using the device.  What  they have to do to
     decipher the message?

A:   They  have to obtain legal authorization, normally a
      , to do the wiretap in the first place.  They
      then present documentation of this authorization to
     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and
     obtain the keys for the device  used by the drug
     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are
     stored separately in  to ensure the security of the key
      system.

Q:   Who will run the key- data banks?

A:   The two key- data banks will be run by two independent
     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the
     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will
     oversee the key- data banks.

Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure
     how strong the security is?  

A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption
     systems readily available today.   the algorithm will
     remain classified to protect the security of the key 
     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of
     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
     potential users that  are no unrecognized
     vulnerabilities.

Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?

A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the
     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in
     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the
     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet
     officials.

Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?

A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on
     encryption issues, and expect  discussions to intensify
     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have
     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
     decisions related to this initiative.

Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?

A:   The government designed and developed the key access
     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the
     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product
     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip
     manufacturer that produces them.

Q:   Who provides the " Chip"?

A:   Mykotronx programs it at  facility in Torrance,
     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device
     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed
     to other vendors in the future.

Q:   How do I buy one of  encryption devices? 

A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating
     the " Chip" into  devices.
     
Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
     solution like the one proposed,  the Administration be
     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
     powerful encryption devices?

A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
     considered during the broad policy review.  The key 
     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product
     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive
     than others readily available today, but it is just one
     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to
     encryption technology, which the Administration is
     developing.

     The Administration is not saying, " encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,
     we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have
     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that "every
     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product."   is a
     false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is
     an "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,
     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the "
     Chip" and similar encryption techniques.

Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton
     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from
     that of the Bush Administration?  

A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption
     technology in telecommunications and computing and are
     committed to working with industry and public-interest
     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'
     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law
     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime
     and terrorism.

Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use
     the government hardware?

A:   Voice encryption devices are  to export control
     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is
     required to ensure appropriate use of  devices.  The
     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the
     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give
     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this
     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a
     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use 
     devices to secure  own communications abroad.  We plan
     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability
     of  products.

 Also not a lawyer, etc. but if I remember correctly the Contempt of 
business is used in  to compel cooperation with what is (perhaps
questionably, different issue) the legitimate business of that . Quite
literally the party is found guilty of holding the  "in contempt". Now,
the original scheme as suggested here  be to have the key disappear if
certain threatening conditions are met. Once the key is gone  is no
question of Contempt of  as  is nothing to compell, the key is no
longer  to be produced.

  Obstruction of justice  be a different issue but if the suspect in
question  have some legitmate reason to protect his data from prying eyes
(however extenuated) I  that this charge  be a hard nut to make. 

  Perhaps it is time for a lawyer to step in and clear this all up?

Well, it now seems obvious what Professor Denning was doing last fall
when this key  trial balloon was raised!

All the more need for end-to-end encryption schemes that bypass the
government-approved system.

By the way, the "" name...isn't this already used for the
 processor from Intergraph? I doubt they're the ones making the
chip, so a name conflict may be present.

	I have a bunch of questions about the encryption scheme
erenced in the  of this message.  What is the relative data
privacy provided by the above sequence as compared with straight DES?
Does the addition of compression then encrypting make the cyphertext
significantly harder to crack using current methods than straight DES?
 running crypt after DES provide greater data privacy?  Is it
important to remove the (constant) compress header before encryption?
Thank you, net, for your wisdom.

                         THE WHITE HOUSE

                  Office of the Press Secretary

_________________________________________________________________

For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993


                STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY


The President today announced a new initiative that will bring
the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary
program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
communications  meeting the legitimate needs of law
enforcement.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.

For too long  has been little or no dialogue between our
private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the
tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of
protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate
the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and
law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against
industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.

Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to
protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now  used to
protect electronic mail and computer files.   encryption
technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the
unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used
by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.

A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the " Chip" has
been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a
new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,
relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to
an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications
using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in
commercial use today.

This new technology will help companies protect proprietary
information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the
ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to
intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. 

A "key-" system will be established to ensure that the
" Chip" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding
Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique


                                2


"keys," numbers that will be needed by authorized government
agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the
device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately
in two "key-" data bases that will be established by the
Attorney General.  Access to  keys will be limited to
government officials with legal authorization to conduct a
wiretap.

The " Chip" technology provides law enforcement with no
new authorities to access the content of the private
conversations of Americans.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the
Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new
devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the
government will be offered access to the confidential details of
the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
 findings.

The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of
encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the
privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield
criminals and terrorists.  We need the " Chip" and other
approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access
to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it
to hide  illegal activities.  In  to assess technology
trends and explore new approaches (like the key- system),
the President has directed government agencies to develop a
comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:

     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to
          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;

     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone
          calls and data, under proper  or other legal
          , when necessary to protect our citizens;

     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern
          technology to build the National Information
          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and
          the competitiveness of American industry in the global
          marketplace; and 

     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export
          high technology products.

The President has directed early and frequent consultations with
affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the
privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.



                                3

The Administration is committed to working with the private
sector to spur the development of a National Information
Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer
technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to
information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks
("information superhighways") will transmit video, images, HDTV
programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone
system transmits voice.

 encryption technology will play an increasingly important
role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act
quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding
its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that
protect all Americans' right to privacy  also protecting
them from  who break the law.

Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. 
The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new
encryption technology are also available.

Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE




Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government
     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?

A:   No.  " Chip" technology provides law enforcement with
     no new authorities to access the content of the private
     conversations of Americans.

Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
     encrypted using the device.  What  they have to do to
     decipher the message?

A:   They  have to obtain legal authorization, normally a
      , to do the wiretap in the first place.  They
      then present documentation of this authorization to
     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and
     obtain the keys for the device  used by the drug
     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are
     stored separately in  to ensure the security of the key
      system.

Q:   Who will run the key- data banks?

A:   The two key- data banks will be run by two independent
     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the
     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will
     oversee the key- data banks.

Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure
     how strong the security is?  

A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption
     systems readily available today.   the algorithm will
     remain classified to protect the security of the key 
     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of
     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
     potential users that  are no unrecognized
     vulnerabilities.

Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?

A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the
     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in
     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the
     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet
     officials.

Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?

A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on
     encryption issues, and expect  discussions to intensify
     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have
     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
     decisions related to this initiative.

Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?

A:   The government designed and developed the key access
     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the
     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product
     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip
     manufacturer that produces them.

Q:   Who provides the " Chip"?

A:   Mykotronx programs it at  facility in Torrance,
     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device
     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed
     to other vendors in the future.

Q:   How do I buy one of  encryption devices? 

A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating
     the " Chip" into  devices.
     
Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
     solution like the one proposed,  the Administration be
     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
     powerful encryption devices?

A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
     considered during the broad policy review.  The key 
     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product
     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive
     than others readily available today, but it is just one
     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to
     encryption technology, which the Administration is
     developing.

     The Administration is not saying, " encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,
     we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have
     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that "every
     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product."   is a
     false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is
     an "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,
     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the "
     Chip" and similar encryption techniques.

Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton
     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from
     that of the Bush Administration?  

A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption
     technology in telecommunications and computing and are
     committed to working with industry and public-interest
     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'
     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law
     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime
     and terrorism.

Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use
     the government hardware?

A:   Voice encryption devices are  to export control
     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is
     required to ensure appropriate use of  devices.  The
     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the
     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give
     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this
     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a
     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use 
     devices to secure  own communications abroad.  We plan
     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability
     of  products.

 they aren't planning to make it public, as was done with DES.  As it
says in both sci.crypt FAQs, 's no way we are going to achieve the
same level of comfort with  that we finally have with DES if we
can't actually get our hands on the bits and watch them flow around.  Even
the best experts aren't going to  of everything: look how long it
took Biham and Shamir to get a handle on just how good DES is... and for
all we know 's  more to learn.

    Lets carry this one step further. Suppose the text of the key is
in itself conclusive evidence of the SAME CRIME for which the
encrypted material is further evidence. I find myself envisaging a
scenario like this:

You have made some scans of Peanuts strips. You encrypt them. The key
is a phrase.

The Comic Police haul you in. They seize your system. They find the
encrypted file.

CP:    "Whats that file?"

You:   "I take the fifth."

CP:    "What's the keyphrase to that file?" 

You:   "I take the fifth."

Judge: "You have to reveal the keyphrase" [I disagree, but I'm not a judge.]

You:   "Your Honor, revealing the keyphrase, in it's own right,  
	tend to incriminate me of breaking laws, independent of what 
	may or may not be in the encrypted file."  

Judge: "I grant you immunity from whatever may be learned from the key
	itself"

You:    "The keyphrase is: "I confess to deliberately evading copyright; 
	the file encoded with this keyphrase contains illegal scans of 
        copyrighted Peanuts strips.""

Judge and CP: "Oh."

     How will they get you now? I'm not saying that they won't, or
can't (or even that they n't :-), but what legal mechanism will
they use?  we be crossposting this to misc.legal?

Nope. The criminals won't be stupid enough to use the new chip,
they'll use something secure. This technology provides only  to
intercept the phone conversations of people who are stupid enough to
use it.

That is, the government has the keys. It doesn't matter much if they
are in one or in two of its hands...

Correct. It does, however, provide  Americans with the false

If the screening is not public, it cannot be trusted. Some people do
not trust DES even today, after all the examinations - only because
some parts of its design were kept secret.

So they'll use a different technology to hide  illegal
activities. So will  law-abiding citizens, who do not trust 
government not to misuse its abilities to decrypt  conversations.

In short, the new technology can:

1) Protect the law abiding citizen's privacy from the casual snooper.

It cannot:

1) Protect him from the government, if it decides to misuse its
ability to decrypt the conversations.

2) Protect him from the criminals who succeed to break the new
encryption scheme or to steal the keys, or to bribe the people who
handle them, etc.

3) Prevent the criminals from using secure encryption for
communication.

 the US government seems to consider strong crypto as munitions

Bullshit. The proposed technology provides a false sense of security,
encryption devices with built-in capabilities for breaking the
encryption, does not prevent the criminals to use strong crypto, and
is a step to outlaw strong crypto.

Who was the optimist who believed that the new administration will
leave the export controls on strong crypto devices?

OK, I'm not American, it's not my business, but I just couldn't resist
to comment... The whole plot looks so totalitaristic... It's up to
you, Americans, to fight for your rights.

The key question is whether non- encryption will be made illegal.

The clear middle ground implied by  statements is to say that Americans
have the right to  encryption, but not to unbreakable encryption.
This implies that, ultimately, non- strong encryption must become
illegal.

(As an aside, isn't the language here jarring?  All this talk about
"harmonious balance" when they're talking about taking away people's
right to communications privacy?)

Although the  emphasizes voice communication, data and mail encryption
is mentioned as well:

>protect electronic mail and computer files.

It looks like the worst nightmares raised by Dorothy Denning's proposals
are coming true.  If the government continues on this course, I imagine
that we will see strong cryptography made illegal.  Encryption programs
for disk files and email, as well as software to allow for encrypted
voice communications, will be distributed only through the
"underground".  People will have to learn how to hide the fact that
they are protecting  privacy.

It's shocking and frightening to see that this is actually happening here.

                         THE WHITE HOUSE

                  Office of the Press Secretary

_________________________________________________________________

For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993


                STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY


The President today announced a new initiative that will bring
the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary
program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
communications  meeting the legitimate needs of law
enforcement.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.

For too long  has been little or no dialogue between our
private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the
tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of
protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate
the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and
law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against
industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.

Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to
protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now  used to
protect electronic mail and computer files.   encryption
technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the
unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used
by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.

A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the " Chip" has
been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a
new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,
relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to
an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications
using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in
commercial use today.

This new technology will help companies protect proprietary
information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the
ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to
intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. 

A "key-" system will be established to ensure that the
" Chip" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding
Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique


                                2


"keys," numbers that will be needed by authorized government
agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the
device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately
in two "key-" data bases that will be established by the
Attorney General.  Access to  keys will be limited to
government officials with legal authorization to conduct a
wiretap.

The " Chip" technology provides law enforcement with no
new authorities to access the content of the private
conversations of Americans.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the
Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new
devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the
government will be offered access to the confidential details of
the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
 findings.

The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of
encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the
privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield
criminals and terrorists.  We need the " Chip" and other
approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access
to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it
to hide  illegal activities.  In  to assess technology
trends and explore new approaches (like the key- system),
the President has directed government agencies to develop a
comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:

     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to
          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;

     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone
          calls and data, under proper  or other legal
          , when necessary to protect our citizens;

     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern
          technology to build the National Information
          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and
          the competitiveness of American industry in the global
          marketplace; and 

     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export
          high technology products.

The President has directed early and frequent consultations with
affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the
privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.



                                3

The Administration is committed to working with the private
sector to spur the development of a National Information
Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer
technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to
information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks
("information superhighways") will transmit video, images, HDTV
programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone
system transmits voice.

 encryption technology will play an increasingly important
role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act
quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding
its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that
protect all Americans' right to privacy  also protecting
them from  who break the law.

Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. 
The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new
encryption technology are also available.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE




Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government
     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?

A:   No.  " Chip" technology provides law enforcement with
     no new authorities to access the content of the private
     conversations of Americans.

Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
     encrypted using the device.  What  they have to do to
     decipher the message?

A:   They  have to obtain legal authorization, normally a
      , to do the wiretap in the first place.  They
      then present documentation of this authorization to
     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and
     obtain the keys for the device  used by the drug
     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are
     stored separately in  to ensure the security of the key
      system.

Q:   Who will run the key- data banks?

A:   The two key- data banks will be run by two independent
     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the
     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will
     oversee the key- data banks.

Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure
     how strong the security is?  

A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption
     systems readily available today.   the algorithm will
     remain classified to protect the security of the key 
     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of
     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
     potential users that  are no unrecognized
     vulnerabilities.

Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?

A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the
     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in
     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the
     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet
     officials.

Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?

A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on
     encryption issues, and expect  discussions to intensify
     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have
     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
     decisions related to this initiative.

Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?

A:   The government designed and developed the key access
     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the
     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product
     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip
     manufacturer that produces them.

Q:   Who provides the " Chip"?

A:   Mykotronx programs it at  facility in Torrance,
     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device
     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed
     to other vendors in the future.

Q:   How do I buy one of  encryption devices? 

A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating
     the " Chip" into  devices.
     
Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
     solution like the one proposed,  the Administration be
     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
     powerful encryption devices?

A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
     considered during the broad policy review.  The key 
     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product
     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive
     than others readily available today, but it is just one
     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to
     encryption technology, which the Administration is
     developing.

     The Administration is not saying, " encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,
     we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have
     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that "every
     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product."   is a
     false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is
     an "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,
     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the "
     Chip" and similar encryption techniques.

Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton
     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from
     that of the Bush Administration?  

A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption
     technology in telecommunications and computing and are
     committed to working with industry and public-interest
     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'
     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law
     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime
     and terrorism.

Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use
     the government hardware?

A:   Voice encryption devices are  to export control
     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is
     required to ensure appropriate use of  devices.  The
     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the
     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give
     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this
     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a
     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use 
     devices to secure  own communications abroad.  We plan
     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability
     of  products.

April 16, 1993

INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROPOSAL

The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on
cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of
millions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a
comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as
export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to
robust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.

However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already
reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any
public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the
Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone
equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the
National Security Agency.  The so-called " Chip" is an 80-bit,
split key ed encryption scheme which will be built into chips
manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate  agents 
store users' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon
presentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be
classified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for
incorporation into its communications products.

     This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .

First, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an
inquiry.  The NSA-developed  Chip may not be the most secure
product. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes.
Furthermore, we  not rely on the government as the sole source for
the  or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers
 be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.

Second, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, the
Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF
believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The
public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is
open to independent, expert scrutiny.  

Third,  the use of the use of a split-key, dual ed system may
prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement
needs, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is
adopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of  keys? 
Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual's Fifth
Amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?   are but a few
of the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to
answer.

In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance
of  issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy
and security.  However, the " Chip" solution ought to be
considered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the
discussion even begins.

DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:



The 80-bit key will be divided between two  agents, each of whom
hold 40-bits of each key.  The manufacturer of the communications device
 be required to register all keys with the two independent 
agents.  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.

Upon presentation of a valid  , the two  agents 
have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  According to
the Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be
asked to identify appropriate  agents.  Some in the Administration
have suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the
Federal Reserve), and one non-governmental  could be chosen,
but  is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.

CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS

The Administration claims that  are no back doors --  by which
the government or others could break the code without securing keys from
the  agents -- and that the President will be told  are no
back doors to this classified algorithm.  In  to prove this,
Administration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto
cracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the
algorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation  then be
made public.

The  Chipset was designed and is  produced and a sole-source,
secret contract between the National Security Agency and two private
firms:  VLSI and Mycotronx.  NSA work on this plan has been underway for
about four years.  The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.

GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER

In  to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes
in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers
for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP Al
Gore, and maybe even the President.  At today's Commerce Department press
briefing, a number of people asked this question, though:  why  any
private  or individual adopt a classified standard that had
no independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors?

COMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRY

The Administration has also announced that it is about to commence an
inquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection, encryption,
and law enforcement.  The items to be considered include:  export
controls on encryption technology and the FBI's Digital Telephony
Proposal.  It appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the
National Security Council.  Unfortunately, however, the Presidential
Directive describing the inquiry is classified.  Some public involvement
in the process has been promised, but they terms have yet to be specified.

I am eager to hear the legal theory behind restricting exchange of
cryptographic data and encrypted messages, given the first admendment;
the theory behind regulating the *personal* encryption of one's personal
*thoughts and feelings* seems even less tenable.

Perhaps if we make a *treaty* with, say, Iceland, to restrict crypto
paraphernalia can a good "end run" around the Constitution happen...
(Treaties -- as someone pointed out -- has the force of any other "law of
the land".  Like the Bill of Rights.)


    Amendment 1

    Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise of; or abridging the freedom of speech,
or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to
petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

    Amendment 2

    A well regulated Militia,  necessary to the security of a free State,
the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

    Amendment 3

    No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the
consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed
by law.

    Amendment 4

    The right of the people to be secure in  persons, houses, papers, and
effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated,
and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or
affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the
persons or things to be seized.

    Amendment 5

    No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous
crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in
cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in
actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be
 for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb;
nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against
himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process
of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just
compensation.


Well -- at least for a few minutes we had some privacy...

What is the expected run time (+/- a factor of 10) on a 486DX/50
using the best known algorithm for finding the shortest path
solution for Rubicks Cube from a randomly chosen position?

I have read the FAQ and followed the recent discussion on Rubicks
Cube but I  believe this question has been answered.  Notice
that I am specifically looking for an algorithm that finds the 
SHORTEST path, not just any solution.

It seems to me that the underlying assumption is that such a program
 need to do a brute force search though 10^20 positions.  That
seems an unreasonably pessimistic assumption to me and I want to 
know if someone has significantly improved on that.

I have some ideas of my own on how to approach this problem, but
before I spend to much time developing them I wanted to know if
someone else has already done the work.

Note:     The following was released by the White House today in
          conjunction with the announcement of the  Chip
          encryption technology.

                           FACT SHEET

                  PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT

The President has approved a directive on "Public Encryption
Management."  The directive provides for the following:

Advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption
are part of a wave of new computer and communications technology. 
Encryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of
communications and data by preventing unauthorized access. 
Advanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to
rapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications. 
 advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the
infrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the
information age.

Despite its benefits, new communications technology can also
frustrate lawful government electronic surveillance.  Sophisticated
encryption can have this effect in the United States.  When
exported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence
activities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has
been possible to preserve a government capability to conduct
electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law
enforcement and national security interests,  at the same time
protecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As
encryption technology improves, doing so will require new,
innovative approaches.

In the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has
developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through
encryption that is substantially more robust than the current
government standard, but also permits ing of the keys needed
to unlock the encryption.  The system for the ing of keys
will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information
only with appropriate legal authorization.

To assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect
and decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted
information, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:

INSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS

The Attorney General of the United States, or her representative,
shall request manufacturers of communications hardware which
incorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed
key- microcircuits in  products.  The fact of law
enforcement access to the ed keys will not be concealed from
the American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to
ensure that any existing or future versions of the key-
microcircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications
hardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the
security of the key- system.  In making this decision, I do
not intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the
government from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that
are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-
 system.

KEY-

The Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate
entities to hold the keys for the key- microcircuits
installed in communications equipment.  In each case, the key
holder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent
unauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only
to government agencies that have established  authority to
acquire the content of  communications that have been
encrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney
General shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which
an agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such
communications.

PROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES

The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate
U.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to
facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted
with key- microcircuits in federal communications systems
that process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this
process to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of
a final standard within six months of this directive. 

The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to
the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct
lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure
law enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General
shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture
Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase.

[An  from comp.org.eff.news, EFFector Online 5.06 - Carl]

                       April 16, 1993

      INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY  
                           PROPOSAL

       The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement 
on cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of 
millions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a 
comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues 
such as export controls which have effectively denied most people 
easy access to robust encryption as well as law enforcement issues 
posed by new technology.

       However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has 
already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before 
any public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the 
Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone 
equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed 
by the National Security Agency. The so-called " Chip" is an 
80-bit, split key ed encryption scheme which will be built into 
chips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate  
agents  store users' keys, and be required to turn them over 
law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The 
encryption scheme used is to be classified, but they chips will be 
available to any manufacturer for incorporation into  
communications products.

       This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .

       First, the Administration appears to be adopting a solution 
before conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed  chip may 
not be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may 
have better schemes. Furthermore, we  not rely on the 
government as the sole source for  or any other chips.  Rather,
independent chip manufacturers  be able to produce chipsets 
based on open standards.

       Second, an algorithm can not be trusted unless it can be tested. 
Yet the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm 
classified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public 
and open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a 
standard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.  

       Third,  the use of the split-key, dual-ed 
system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and 
law enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored 
publicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the 
safety of  keys?  Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive 
individual's fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal 
inquiries?  

       In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the 
importance of  issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into 
digital privacy and security.  However, the " chip" solution 
ought to be considered as part of the inquiry, not be adopted before 
the discussion even begins.

DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:



The 80-bit key will be divided between two  agents, each of 
whom hold 40 bits of each key.  Upon presentation of a valid 
warrant, the two  agents  have to turn the key parts 
over to law enforcement agents.  Most likely the Attorney General 
will be asked to identify appropriate  agents.  Some in the 
Administration have suggested one non-law enforcement federal 
agency, perhaps the Federal Reserve, and one non-governmental 
.  But,  is no agreement on the identity of the agents 
yet.

Key registration  be done by the manufacturer of the 
communications device.  A key is tied to the device, not to the person 
using it.

CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS

The Administration claims that  are no back door  by 
which the government or others could break the code without 
securing keys from the  agents and that the President will 
be told  are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In  
to prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for 
an all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security 
arrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results 
of the investigation  then be made public.

GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER

In  to get a market moving, and to show that the government 
believes in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big 
customers for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, 
VP Al Gore, and maybe even the President.

Though some may argue about the nose of the camel, it's worth noting that
the government proposal is limited to scrambled telephony. If it is only
used for that purpose, and does not extend to electronic mail or file
encryption, then it IS an improvement over the current mass-produced
standard civilian technology which, with a few exceptions, is limited to
easy-to-break inverters.

Note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap.
Before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for
e-mail and files, let's focus on this.

One question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is
limited to telephony, or if the government intends to expand it.

Though I share many of the concerns expressed by some, I find the proposal
less threatening than many others,  right now most Americans have no
secure telephony, and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a "goat" can
eavesdrop. This  also plug up the security hole in cellular and
cordless phones.

-------

Reading between the , I infer that the system is highly secure
without access to the keys. This  meet the needs of U.S. businesses
confronted by rich and powerful adversaries, including French and Japanese
security services and rich Japanese companies. It allows the NSA to make
available some of its better stuff  protecting law enforcement needs.

Most legitimate U.S. corporations trust the NSA, and  be delighted to
have a high-security system certified by them, even at the price of
depositing keys in . I see no difficulty in creating a reliable
. Corporations entrust  secrets to attorneys every day of the
week, and that system has worked pretty well.

From my point of view this is a fair starting point.  are concerns that
need to be addressed, including the reliability of the s. But in
return we get access to high-security crypto. Many have suggested that DES
and other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly
skilled and endowed.  is at least a good possibility (which  be
checked) that the proposed system is not so breakable. It doesn't have to
be, nor does it have to have trapdoors, if the government can get the keys
pursuant to a legitimate  . Thus they can protect legitimate
communications against economic adversaries,    able to
eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a  .

------

In discussing this, let's try to avoid the nastiness, personal attacks and
noise of some previous threads. This is a substantive and technical issue,
and personal remarks have no place in such a discussion.

Presumably, the key split is so that no one group controls the privacy
of the key, and that it  be infeasible to illicitly gain access from
both agents.

However, if one agent wishes to break the crypto without the cooperation
of the other agent, a 40-bit key is not going to stand in the way of a
brute force attack.  If an agency (for example, the NSA) were to hold one
of the two key-halves, then I  imagine they  need the other half of
the key to start listening in.

Or was that the point?   <grin>


(This is not to imply, at all, that I like the idea of the rest of the
system.)

How can the government tell which encryption method one is using without
 able to decode the traffic? i.e., In  to accuse me of using an
unauthorized strong encryption technique they  have to take both
keys out of , run them against my ciphertext and "draw a blank".

I can imagine the ciphertext exhibiting certain statistical
characteristics that might give a clue as to the encryption technique
used, but not enough to give a handle for diferential cryptoanalysis.
However, superencipherment or some other scheme that shapes the percieved
properties of my ciphertext could thwart this.

It has been done already!

In the UK the Atari ST box was shipped with 360K disks in the first few
years and then later 720K disks. In  to make life less complicated,
many freebie disks on mags were double formatted like this. Side 0 of the
disk had 360K on it and could be read  by any ST. It also had a flip-side
program. This  swap the sides around so that side 1 became side 0.

I have a wonderful encrypter you can borrow that converts a message
eg "Meet me at 11:30 to bomb the White House. Bring some dynamite"
to an apparently (relatively) innoculous message. This message
here is an example of the output for the above message :-).

>It's shocking and frightening to see that this is actually happening here.

It is shockiong that it could happen anywhere.
It is shocking that it could happen in a country 
that has the arrogance to call itself free.

What you can do:
	(1) Write to your congress person in plain text.
	(2) Write to your congress person in encrypted text.
		(decrypter optional)
	(3) Send some random keystroked to your congressperson
	(4) Send some random keystrokes accross the US boundaries,
		and keep the spooks busy trying to decode it.
	(5) Write your own encryption algorithms.
	(6)  buy  products.

P.S. I can't work out why the US government doesn't want to sell
them overseas. After all, they are rather easy for US interests to decode,
so make a perfect tool for industrial/military espionage...lulling 
anyone stupid enough to buy it into a false sense of security. You will
notice that  is NO mention anywhere about safety for non-Americans.

Disclaimer: My opinions are mine alone, and do not represent anyone elses.
I have nothing that I particularly want to hide at the moment...though I 
consider the right
to be able to use whatever method of coding data I like to be high on my
list of priorities.

               COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS CALL FOR PUBLIC 
           DEBATE ON NEW GOVERNMENT ENCRYPTION INITIATIVE

	Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) 
today called for the public disclosure of technical data 
underlying the government's newly-announced "Public Encryption 
Management" initiative.  The new cryptography scheme was 
announced today by the White House and the National Institute 
for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the 
technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman 
acknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super-
secret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the 
encryption technology around which the new initiative is built.

	According to NIST, the technical specifications and the 
Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To 
open the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today 
filed a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests 
with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security 
Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption 
plan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the 
Computer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in  to 
open the development of non-military computer security standards 
to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of 
such standards.

	CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in 
developing the so-called "digital signature standard" (DSS), a 
communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for 
government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA 
lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first 
time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard.  
NSA is due to file papers in federal  next week justifying 
the classification of records concerning its creation of the 
DSS.

	 Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the 
administration's apparent commitment to the privacy of 
electronic communications, as lected in today's official 
statement,  "a step in the right direction."  But he questioned 
the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent 
secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from 
public scrutiny.  "At a time when we are moving towards the 
development of a new information infrastructure, it is vital 
that standards designed to protect personal privacy be 
established openly and with full public participation.  It is 
not appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of 
secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to 
play a leading role in the development process."

FACT:  It is unlawful to distribute code implementing RSA without a license
to do so from PKP, whether or not one is charging for it.  Furthermore,
any use of RSA, other than for research purposes allowed under US patent
law, is similarly unlawful.  Theore, the "average citizen" cannot use
RSA to encrypt message traffic in the US without a license from PKP.

 is no licensed, freely available product in the US that uses RSA
encryption other than RSA (and hence ), at least as far as I am
aware.  If you know of another, please post it here.

FACT:  The last contact I had with RSA Data Security, Inc was with some
guy trying to sell me a license (unsolicited, I might add) for TIPEM.
Cost: $15K plus 2-5 percent royalties.

I suppose it is a matter of opinion as to whether or not  terms count
as "mucho bucks" or "incredibly reasonable."  Either way, however, this
definitely falls into the "routines *they* tell you to (use)".

FACT:   are no restrictions (yet!) on the use of cryptography under
US law, although this is beginning to look like it will change.  The only
impediments to widespread use of RSA cryptography in the US are PKP's
patents.

	Mr. Cain, please shut up until you get your facts straight.

I somehow started to doubt technical competence of the
people who designed the system.  Why on the Earth split the
80-bit key in 40-bit parts to keep them in  separately
(having 40 bit and large volumes of data voice links produce
it  be relatively easy to break it) when they simply
could keep 80-bit sequences in N (N>=2) independent places
and then XOR all the partial keys to get the actual key (N-1
sequences  obviously be selected randomly and Nth is the
actual key XOR-ed with the random sequences).

(Or is it a conspiracy? 1/2 :-)

Getting rid of the keys is actually pretty easy to do automatically on
a communications link, as opposed to storage where the keys have to be
retained somehow as long as the owner wants to be able to retrieve the
data.

The right way to do communications security is to generate a random
session key with Diffie Hellman, use it for a  and then destroy
it. Once it's gone, 's no getting it back, and no way to decrypt
recordings of the conversation.

To make sure you aren't  attacked by a man in the middle, you
have to authenticate your DH exchanges. The AT&T secure phone does
this by displaying the DH key so you can compare them verbally over
the phone. This is nice and simple, but it relies on user awareness
plus the inability of the man in the middle to duplicate the users'
voices.

A better way is to authenticate the exchanges with RSA.  you'd
never use RSA for actual encryption, compromising your RSA secret key
 only allow someone to impersonate you in a future conversation,
and even that only until you revoke your public key.  They  
not be able to decrypt recordings of prior conversations for which the
session keys have been destroyed.

I'm convinced that this is how the government's own secure phones
(the STU-III) must work. Neat, eh?

Okay, let's suppose that the NSA/NIST/Mykotronix Registered
Key system becomes standard and I'm able to buy such a system
from my local radio shack. Every phone comes with a built in
chip and the government has the key to every phone call. 
I go and buy a phone and dutifully register the key. 

What's to prevent me from swapping phones with a friend or 
buying a used phone at a garage sale? Whooa. The secret registered
keys just became unsynchronized. When the government comes 
to listen in, they only receive gobbledly-gook because the 
secret key registered under my name isn't the right one. 

That leads me to conjecture that:

1) The system isn't that secure.  are just two master keys
that work for all the phones in the country. The part about
registering your keys is just bogus. 

or 

2) The system is vulnerable to simple phone swapping attacks
like this. Criminals will quickly figure this out and go to
town.

In either case, I  we need to look at this a bit deeper."'jbl)mW:wxlD2

Quite interesting.  How does the US administration intend to persuade

	I was ing about this, also. It's quite possible the
system transmits, in clear, the serial number of the device 
used. That way they can start a tap, get the serial number, and use
the warrant for the first tap to get the key.

	If they tap someone who's apparently using encryption, but
 find that pix, then they'll assume it's an "un-authorized"
encryption scheme.

As of yet,  has been no description of the general principles
behind the  proposal. For example, is this a public key system
or a private key system? If the latter, then I  see how the
system could work (given that the keys are tied to the device and
not the person).

Further, the ed 80-bit keys are split into two 40-bit chunks.
I  guess that the availability of one of  40-bit chunks
and a reasonable key-search machine,  allow you to read the traffic.
I'm not suggesting that this is a deliberate weakness of the system,
but it does make you . Of course, this is easily fixable by 
giving out two 80-bit chunks which could be x-ored to generate the 
real 80-bit key.

Talk about adding insult to injury ... 

I, for one, believe that the use of civil forfeiture  be abolished by
a decent administration, not continued.  Instead, it looks like that
ill-gotten gain will be used to help pay for wiretap equipment.

                            Great... nice choice of bad guys to
                            convince everyone how "bad" unrestricted
                            encryption is.  Why not use a child
                            molester instead?  Of course, the word
                            *suspect* is never used here, so I guess
                             people have already been convicted
                            and are operating this drug ring from
                             jail cells.

How about *this* question instead?

Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
     a political opponent of a senior administration official and
     intercepts a conversation...

Kinda changes your interpretation of the event, doesn't it?  And yes,
the presence of the  Chip DOES change things, because it will
not only give the people talking on the phone a false sense of security,
it will also give federal law enforcement agencies the justification
to deny use of strong encryption methods that are inconvenient to them.
Dang it all, it's SUPPOSED to be inconvenient (but not impossible).
That's the ONLY sure way to make sure that abuses are minimized 
 allowing legitimate law enforcement access.

Uh huh... sure.  I predict that within two months (weeks?) of the chip's
debut, the full technical details will be posted to sci.crypt.  And if
this has ANY impact on the security of the key  system, then we've
been lied to.  Any cryptosystem worth its salt can withstand the light
of public scrutiny, and  is NO WAY you can be sure that an
algorithm has no "unrecognized vulnerabilities" unless you have half
the world trying to break it for a decade or so.  Even then, you gotta
be caul.

Without real technical details, it's hard to answer this question. But

40 bits of real key material? Maybe they're using the exportable version
of RC2...? :-)

			    THE WHITE HOUSE

		     Office of the Press Secretary

   _________________________________________________________________

   For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993


		   STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY


   The President today announced a new initiative that will bring
   the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary
   program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
   communications  meeting the legitimate needs of law
   enforcement.

   The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
   accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
   telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.

   For too long  has been little or no dialogue between our
   private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the
   tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of
   protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate
   the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and
   law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against
   industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.

   Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to
   protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now  used to
   protect electronic mail and computer files.   encryption
   technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the
   unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used
   by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.

   A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the " Chip" has
   been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a
   new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,
   relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to
   an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications
   using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in
   commercial use today.

   This new technology will help companies protect proprietary
   information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
   and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
   electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the
   ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to
   intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. 

   A "key-" system will be established to ensure that the
   " Chip" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding
   Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique


				   2


   "keys," numbers that will be needed by authorized government
   agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the
   device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately
   in two "key-" data bases that will be established by the
   Attorney General.  Access to  keys will be limited to
   government officials with legal authorization to conduct a
   wiretap.

   The " Chip" technology provides law enforcement with no
   new authorities to access the content of the private
   conversations of Americans.

   To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the
   Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new
   devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the
   government will be offered access to the confidential details of
   the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
    findings.

   The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of
   encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the
   privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield
   criminals and terrorists.  We need the " Chip" and other
   approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access
   to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it
   to hide  illegal activities.  In  to assess technology
   trends and explore new approaches (like the key- system),
   the President has directed government agencies to develop a
   comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:

	--   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to
	     employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;

	--   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone
	     calls and data, under proper  or other legal
	     , when necessary to protect our citizens;

	--   the effective and timely use of the most modern
	     technology to build the National Information
	     Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and
	     the competitiveness of American industry in the global
	     marketplace; and 

	--   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export
	     high technology products.

   The President has directed early and frequent consultations with
   affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the
   privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.



				   3

   The Administration is committed to working with the private
   sector to spur the development of a National Information
   Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer
   technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to
   information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks
   ("information superhighways") will transmit video, images, HDTV
   programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone
   system transmits voice.

    encryption technology will play an increasingly important
   role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act
   quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding
   its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that
   protect all Americans' right to privacy  also protecting
   them from  who break the law.

   Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. 
   The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new
   encryption technology are also available.

   Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.

   ---------------------------------


   QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S
   TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE




   Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government
	agencies to listen in on phone conversations?

   A:   No.  " Chip" technology provides law enforcement with
	no new authorities to access the content of the private
	conversations of Americans.

   Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
	a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
	encrypted using the device.  What  they have to do to
	decipher the message?

   A:   They  have to obtain legal authorization, normally a
	 , to do the wiretap in the first place.  They
	 then present documentation of this authorization to
	the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and
	obtain the keys for the device  used by the drug
	smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are
	stored separately in  to ensure the security of the key
	 system.

   Q:   Who will run the key- data banks?

   A:   The two key- data banks will be run by two independent
	entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the
	Administration have yet to determine which agencies will
	oversee the key- data banks.

   Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure
	how strong the security is?  

   A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption
	systems readily available today.   the algorithm will
	remain classified to protect the security of the key 
	system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of
	cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
	potential users that  are no unrecognized
	vulnerabilities.

   Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?

   A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the
	Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in
	this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the
	President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet
	officials.

   Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?

   A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on
	encryption issues, and expect  discussions to intensify
	as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have
	briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
	decisions related to this initiative.

   Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?

   A:   The government designed and developed the key access
	encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the
	microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product
	manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip
	manufacturer that produces them.

   Q:   Who provides the " Chip"?

   A:   Mykotronx programs it at  facility in Torrance,
	California, and will sell the chip to encryption device
	manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed
	to other vendors in the future.

   Q:   How do I buy one of  encryption devices? 

   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating
	the " Chip" into  devices.

   Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
	solution like the one proposed,  the Administration be
	willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
	powerful encryption devices?

   A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
	considered during the broad policy review.  The key 
	mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product
	that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive
	than others readily available today, but it is just one
	piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to
	encryption technology, which the Administration is
	developing.

	The Administration is not saying, " encryption
	threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,
	we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have
	effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that "every
	American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
	unbreakable commercial encryption product."   is a
	false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is
	an "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,
	and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,
	balanced approach such as is proposed with the "
	Chip" and similar encryption techniques.

   Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton
	Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from
	that of the Bush Administration?  

   A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption
	technology in telecommunications and computing and are
	committed to working with industry and public-interest
	groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'
	privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law
	enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime
	and terrorism.

   Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use
	the government hardware?

   A:   Voice encryption devices are  to export control
	requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is
	required to ensure appropriate use of  devices.  The
	same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the
	attractions of this technology is the protection it can give
	to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this
	in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a
	case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use 
	devices to secure  own communications abroad.  We plan
	to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability
	of  products.

This may be a stupid question, but how does the government know which keys
to ask for?

Will owners be required to REGISTER  phones, faxes, modems, etc.,
and inform the government when they are moved to a different phone number?
Will  be penalities if the public does not do this?  Will identification
(the National Health Care ID, perhaps) be required when purchasing a
-equipted phone?

Or will each chip transmit identifying information at the start of
a conversation?  Identification which could be used to automatically
log who calls whom?  (The _phone_ company keeps records, but this 
information  be accessable by a well-placed van near a microwave
relay station).

This raises the question of how the two phones agree on a communications
encryption key.  Will it be something that is derived from information
exchanged at the start of the conversation -- and hence derivable by
an eavesdropper?

The stragegy of the government is interesting.  The real fear comes from
them doing more than this.

This is a voluntary program, and thus harder for us to object to on
the surface.

 strategy is a business one rather than legal one.  They are
pushing to get a standard in place, a secret standard, and if they
get it as a standard then they will drive competitors out of the market.
It will be legal to sell better, untapable encryption that doesn't have
registered keys, but it will be difficult, and thus not a plan for
most phone companies.

You see, with  chip phones you'll be able to talk to any
cellular company, or other phones or ports because they will follow
the standard.  AT&T has already announced a  chip encryption
product.  The government has marketed hard to get major vendors to
use  chips.   If they get enough market share, they will rule.

And thus  will be very little market for systems that can't be
tapped by the police.  The public isn't that concerned about it now,
after all.  They freely do calls that anybody with an old TV can listen
to today!  They won't pay big extra bucks for proprietary phones that secure
them only from the police.

Well, some people will buy  phones, but they will only work with
other proprietary phones, so the market will be small and the phones
expensive.  Unless they are made in numbers large enough to sell them
cheap, only the Mob will buy them.

And this  that the FBI will want to track the customer lists of
better encryption phones, because "the only reason a person  want
one is to evade the police."

Interesting.

About 18 months ago, I heard a report on NPR about a 900-number
"1-900-STO-PPER" or some such, for placing untraceable calls.
You call them, and on "bong" tone dial the number you want to
call; they told the NPR interviewer that nothing short of a
  (which they'd fight)  make them release 
records.

I'm quite astonished, shocked, and appalled at this serious frontal 
assault on emerging American freedoms.  The Clinton administration 
nor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever 
in regulating cryptography. To do so is tantamount to regulating 
`acceptable' speech, and is blatantly unconstitutional. Perhaps we 
 rename this year `1984' in honor of such an illustrious 
proposal.  Let the Crappy Chip live in infamy, and the adminstration
receive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure.

I am outraged that my tax money is  used to develop technology
to restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures.  The U.S.
government will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any
serious threat to my liberties such as this, and I call on everyone
with an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this 
proposal.  The administration does not seem to understand that they
are merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the
public, and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is 
wholly negligent and remiss in performing  lawful duty.

It seems to me that U.S. Diplomatic communications  be 
tappable by the U.N. whenever any countries produce a warrant to
the U.N.  In fact, I  we  stop paying the NSA billions
of dollars a year to produce unbreakable codes for this reason.
 actions violate the sovereignity of international law. (I hope
Mr. Clinton is shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here.
But if he isn't, it's a modest and reasonable proposal, so he 
find merit with it nevertheless.)

Cryptography is neutral technology. If everybody has strong 
cryptography (including policemen, bureacrats, businessmen, 
housewives, thugs and hoodlums), we have a sustainable 
equilibrium.  Anything less is an unworkable anti-egaltarian 
arrangement, intrinsically antithetical to American freedoms, and
guaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent 
impracticality. We  need to compromise on issues of freedom.

For too long our government has demonstrated itself to be

and protecting Americans.

It is not possible for the Federal Government
to ``act quickly'' or develop ``consistent, comprehensive
policies'' PERIOD.  And even if by some grandiose miracle such
a thing were possible, it  only be an efficient way to
deprive American citizens of fundamental and inalienable rights.

The administration has to be committed to leaving private 
industries alone, esp. on this issue.  The government has no 
legitimate role in regulating the content of communications.
Law enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit 
surveillance bludgeon; they are soon and inevitably to be 
disarmed of it.

No such laws can be constitutionally sound, and this is equivalent
to a veiled threat, which I  appreciate.  This kind of 
extortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism. I will
trade threats for threats, and violation for violation.

If the administration did say this, it  find itself 
impeached for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential,
established, entrenched, and explicit constitutional privacy 
guarantees. The administration  have no legal standing 
whatsoever; such an action  be egregiously illegal and
criminal, and wholly untolerated and disregarded by vast 
segments of the population.

The U.S., comprised of a vast majority of people fanatically 
committed to preserving  privacy in the face of an 
increasingly totalitarian government, is saying just that.  
Take your chips and give them to NSA employees as Christmas bonuses.
We can run any algorithm on our computers we damn well please, 
and we will make any chips we please, and we will send any bit 
pattern over our data highways we please. And if you try to stop 
us, you will be gradually or abruptly dissolved into nothingness.

This is an outright Dingaling Denning lie.  The two aims of
privacy and surveillance are intrinsically and fundamentally 
incompatible, and you have to work for the NSA to  otherwise. 
Americans are about to discover ways, through the use of technology, 
to preserve  inalienable but forgotten freedoms that have slowly 
been eroded away by an increasingly distant and unresponsive and 
*unrepresentative* government.

Besides  an infringement on our civil liberties (not the 
in this post), the name " Chip" seems very confusable with the
"" chip of Intergraph.

Originally designed by a team at Fairchild Semiconductor,  was
a 32-bit RISC microprocessor. It is  used in some workstations,
notably  from Intergraph, the supplier of CAD tools. Intergraph
acquired the  product line when Fairchild was sold to National
Semiconductor several years back.

When I first saw " Chip" in the announcement, I immediately
thought the  was erring to the  chip I know.

This seems to be grounds for Intergraph to sue, but then I'm not a
lawyer. I'd say I'm a cryptologist, but I  want to incriminate
myself under the laws of the new regime.

I  know if this is  true, but at one time Coca-Cola
took elaborate measures to keep the formula secret.  For instance,
several plants in different cities each made one of six partial
concentrates, which were then shipped back-and forth and remixed
in a complicated scheme so that no single plant made the whole
formula.  By now, I  guess that PepsiCo's chemists  have
reverse-engineered it; can't be all that exotic.  Actually I
per Pepsi anyhow; in about 3 minutes I'm gonna put money

The  Chip will have no effect.  Current generation PCs, portable
and desktop, all have analog voice -> digital voice and vice versa
capabilities.  So, I only need a modem output to the telephone,
and I can interpose any encryption screen on my voice traffic I want.

Not even a big deal, but it will pass muster if the have a way
of checking whether I am using   Chip encryption without
a full decoding.

I have been chided for stating that Dorthy Denning was intellectually
dishonest in the ACM debate and in this newsgroup.  I have previously
rained from suggesting that she is arguing on behalf of consulting
clients.

Now, I say that it is clear that Dorthy Denning has been functioning
as a lobbyist, not a computer scientist.  She has used legal ethics
(truth is what you can convince anyone of), not scientific ethics
(truth is understanding the external world).

Maybe we can revoke her ACM membership? 8)

	This doesn't handle superencrypted traffic. If the 
doesn't impose any unfortunate performance side-effects 's no
reason not to use it to superencrypt a stream of triple-DES encrypted
traffic. That way your traffic looks "normal" and perhaps anyone
desiring to listen in won't even bother,  they know nobody's
going to  trust crypto that has classified internals for
important stuff.

Stupid me. I believed the Democrats stood for principles of personal
privacy  it was the Neanderthal Republicans that wanted into every
aspect of our lives. 

Clinton is just more clever than the other guy. Looks like gun control for
privacy technology. One small step at a time.

Wait a minute....  Let me  about this.

Hmmm, I feel better now. I believe the White House when they tell us
this first step is, in fact, the final step. All is OK. We've nothing to fear.
They're here to help us. 

God bless America.

	Then they'll probably also want to start tracking the customer
lists of people purchasing SoundBlaster and similar boards, which can
be configured with the use of some code and a modem, to act as a pretty
decent digital-encrypting telephone. It's expensive, though, and kind
of awkward. I  know any drug lords, but I'm sure they'd favor
something tappable over something secure as long as the user interface
is nice.

	When you've got HRH Prince of Wales saying stupid things over
cordless phones, it's not hard to imagine that drug dealers, child
pornographers, commies, LISP programmers, and other threats to the
civilized world might transact incriminating business over "encrypting"
cellular phones.

More than shocking.  What this says to me is no less than that government
is very interested in monitoring the public.  This does more than scare me,
it mortifies me.

PGP and  must become widespread enough to resist what Mr. Finney has
[IMHO correctly] identified as the next logical step.  What was once an
academic discussion with regard to concealing cyphertext, has now become
a real consideration.

The rhetoric that the clinton administration seems obsessed with, harmony,
either or propositions, tension, tells me that they know how difficult
it will be to sell this proposition.

The phrase I hear more and more is "I can't believe this is actually happening
here."  Call me conserative, Clinton was a huge mistake that we'll all be
paying for tommorow and many years from now.

Have we approached the age of speakeasy public key depositiories?

If Brad's analysis is correct, it may offer an explanation for why the
encryption algorithm is  kept secret.  This will prevent competitors
from coming out with -compatible phones which lack the government-
installed "back door."  The strategy Brad describes will only work as long
as the only way to get compatible phones is to have ones with the government
chips.

(It  be nice, from the point of view of personal privacy, if Brad
turns out to be right.  As long as people  have the power to provide
 own encryption in place of or in addition to the , privacy
is  possible.  But the wording of several passages in the announcement
makes me doubt whether this will turn out to be true.)

My thoughts on why the algorithm is secret :

   The chip is (regretably) likely to become a standard.    will
   be many applications where economic factors dictate use of this
   chip, like it or not.

   If the alrogithm is public, and the code is as secure (absent the 
   access to ed keys) as represented, an enterprising sort 
    make "compatible crypto chips for which no key had been
   ed".  This is likely what the release was ering to when 
   they ered to the secrecy of the algorithm protecting the
   security of the  system.

The actual algorithm is classified, however,  main thrust here is
for cellular phones, and encryption is only over the radio end, not
end to end, I .   End to end will come later.

And of course you have to identify yourself to the phone company, and
 the phone company complies with  s, they will know the
magic number of your chip when they sign out a warrant on you, and
then can present the warrant to the key  house.

Let's assume, for the moment, that the system  is secure unless
you get both halves of the encryption key from the two independent
 houses.  Let's say you even trust the  houses -- one is
the ACLU and the other is the EFF.  (And I'm not entirely joking about
 two names)

In that case the Prince of Wales has nothing to worry about on this
system.  Indeed, as pointed out,  the current systems, even the
current digital systems, are very easy to decode -- right now anybody
with an old TV can hear them -- for most people, this will be viewed
as an "oh goody" step upwards.

And look at how tolerant the public is.  They're willing to let the
neighbours with the radios hear right now.

It was suggested by one person that a *lot* of non-evidentiary wiretapping
is going on right now without warrants, because anybody can do it and it's
just an ECPA violation.  This  stop that.  All tapping  need
a warrant, or a breach of security at the  houses.

It occurs to me that if they get a wiretap  on you, and the 
houses release your code to the cops, your code is now no longer secure.

It's in the hands of cops, and  I am sure most of the time they are
good,  security will not be as good as the  houses.


What this effectively  is that if they perform a wiretap on you,
at the end of the wiretap, they  be obligated to inform you that
a tap was performed, and replace (for free) the  chip in your
cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the
 houses.

Do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are
laid?   In many ways, it  be a positive step if they had to.
Judges set time limits on warrants, I assume.  At the end of the time
limit they  have to renew or replace your chip.


That's if we go with this scheme, which I am not sure I agree with.

Hey, it's better than the status quo.

I am far less worried about "the feds" tapping my phone than high school 
scanner surfers who get  kicks out of eavesdropping on cellular and 
cordless phone calls.

It  be stupid to rely on even a "ized" channel for truly 
sensitive material, but it *does* seem to finally offer a reasonable way to 
guard against casual eavesdropping.  For example, even with my strong "right 
to bear arms" view of the private right to possess and use strong 
cryptosystems, the system as described provides enough security that I  
actually buy a cordless phone, and  be much less wary of using cellular 
phones, walkie-talkies, and so on.  As long as it's only used for mass-market 
voice scrambling, I actually  see a problem with it.

If you want more security than it offers, use something different.  Use PKCS 
for electronic mail, CELP over DES or triple DES with Diffie-Hellman key 
exchange for your voice traffic, or whatever.

And yes, I'd rather just see all crypto restrictions lifted, but this is at 
least an incrememental improvement for certain applications...

* Why is the one-time pad secure?
* What's a ciphertext-only attack?

* What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?


* In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?

  A private-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system E and a
  decryption system D. The encryption system E is a collection of
  functions E_K, indexed by ``keys'' K, mapping some set of
  ``plaintexts'' P to some set of ``ciphertexts'' C. Similarly the
  decryption system D is a collection of functions D_K such that
  D_K(E_K(P)) = P for every plaintext P.  That is, succesful decryption
  of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key
  (index) as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext
  into ciphertext.  Such systems, wherein the same key value is used to
  encrypt and decrypt, are also known as ``symmetric'' cryptoystems.

* What is an attack?

  In intuitive terms a (passive) attack on a cryptosystem is any method
  of starting with some information about plaintexts and 
  corresponding ciphertexts under some (unknown) key, and figuring out
  more information about the plaintexts. It's possible to state
  mathematically what this . Here we go.

  Fix functions F, G, and H of n variables. Fix an encryption system E,
  and fix a  of plaintexts and keys.

  An attack on E using G assuming F giving H with probability p is an
  algorithm A with a pair f, g of inputs and one output h, such that
   is probability p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n), if we have
  f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and g = G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)). Note that this
  probability depends on the  of the vector (K,P_1,...,P_n).

  The attack is trivial (or ``pointless'') if  is probability at
  least p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n) if f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and
  g = G(C_1,...,C_n). Here C_1,...,C_n range uniformly over the possible
  ciphertexts, and have no particular relation to P_1,...,P_n. In other
  words, an attack is trivial if it doesn't actually use the encryptions
  E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n).

  An attack is called ``one-ciphertext'' if n = 1, ``two-ciphertext'' if
  n = 2, and so on.

* What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?

  In basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure.
  Read part 3: we keep saying ``a strong cryptosystem must have this
  property, but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem
  is strong!''

  In contrast, the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely
  formulate and, if possible, prove the statement that a cryptosystem is
  strong. We say, for example, that a cryptosystem is secure against
  all (passive) attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system (as
  defined above) is too slow to be practical. If we can prove this
  statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist
  any (passive) cryptanalytic technique. If we can reduce this statement
  to some well-known unsolved problem then we  have confidence that
  the cryptosystem isn't easy to break.

  Other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical
  definition. Again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions
  we're making and prove that they produce the desired results. We can
  figure out what it  for a particular cryptosystem to be used
  properly: it just  that the assumptions are valid.

  The same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too. The cryptanalyst
  can take advantage of incorrect assumptions. Often he can try to
  construct a proof of security for a system, see where the proof fails,
  and use  failures as the starting points for his analysis.
  
* Why is the one-time pad secure?

  By definition, the one-time pad is a cryptosystem where the
  plaintexts, ciphertexts, and keys are all strings (say byte strings)
  of some length m, and E_K(P) is just the sum (let's say the exclusive
  or) of K and P.

  It is easy to prove mathematically that  are _no_ nontrivial
  single-ciphertext attacks on the one-time pad, assuming a uniform
   of keys. Note that we  have to assume a uniform
   of plaintexts. (Here's the proof: Let A be an attack,
  i.e., an algorithm taking two inputs f, g and producing one output h,
  with some probability p that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and
  g = G(E_K(P)) (i.e., g = G(K + P)). Then, because the  of
  K is uniform and independent of P, the  of K + P must also
  be uniform and independent of P. But also the  of C is
  uniform and independent of P. Hence  is probability exactly p
  that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and g = G(C), over all P and C. Thus
  a fortiori A is trivial.)

  On the other hand the one-time pad is _not_ secure if a key K is used
  for more than one plaintext: i.e.,  are nontrivial
  multiple-ciphertext attacks. So to be properly used a key K must be
  thrown away after one encryption. The key is also called a ``pad'';
  this explains the name ``one-time pad.''

* What's a ciphertext-only attack?

  In the notation above, a ciphertext-only attack is one where F is
  constant. Given only some information G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)) about
  n ciphertexts, the attack has to have some chance of producing some
  information H(P_1,...,P_n) about the plaintexts. The attack is trivial
  if it has just as good a chance of producing H(P_1,...,P_n) when given
  G(C_1,...,C_n) for random C_1,...,C_n.

  For example, say G(C) = C, and say H(P) is the first bit of P. We can
  easily write down an attack---the ``guessing attack,'' which simply
  guesses that H(P) is 1. This attack is trivial because it doesn't use
  the ciphertext: it has a fifty-fifty chance of guessing correctly no
  matter what. On the other hand  is an attack on RSA which
  produces one bit of information about P, with 100% success, using C.
  If it is fed a random C then the success rate drops to 50%. So this is
  a nontrivial attack.

* What's a known-plaintext attack?

  The classic known-plaintext attack has F(P_1,P_2) = P_1,
  G(C_1,C_2) = (C_1,C_2), and H(P_1,P_2) depending only on P_2.
  In other words, given two ciphertexts C_1 and C_2 and one decryption
  P_1, the known-plaintext attack  produce information about the
  other decryption P_2.

  Note that known-plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature
  as producing information about the key, but this is pointless: the
  cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him
  decrypt further messages.

* What's a chosen-plaintext attack?

  A chosen-plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical
  series of _active_ attacks on a cryptosystem: attacks where the
  cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor.  attacks  fit into
  our model of passive attacks explained above. Anyway, a
  chosen-plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and
  look at the corresponding ciphertext, then repeat until he has figured
  out how to decrypt any message. More absurd examples of this sort of
  attack are the ``chosen-key attack'' and ``chosen-system attack.''

  A much more important form of active attack is a message corruption
  attack, where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a
  way as to make a useful change in the plaintext.

   are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of  attacks:
  for instance, automatically encrypting any plaintext P as
  T,E_K(h(T+R+P),R,P), where T is a time-key (sequence number) chosen anew
  for each message, R is a random number, and h is a one-way hash
  function. Here comma  concatenation and plus  exclusive-or.

* In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?

  Consider the following known-plaintext attack. We are given some
  plaintexts P_1,...,P_{n-1} and ciphertexts C_1,...,C_{n-1}. We're
  also given a ciphertext C_n. We run through every key K. When we find
  K such that E_K(P_i) = C_i for every i < n, we print D_K(C_n).

  If n is big enough that only one key works, this attack will succeed
  on valid inputs all the time,  it will produce correct results
  only once in a blue moon for random inputs. Thus this is a nontrivial
  attack. Its only problem is that it is very slow if  are many
  possible keys.

* What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?

  Say somebody is using the one-time pad---but isn't choosing keys
  randomly and uniformly from all m-bit messages, as he was supposed to
  for our security proof. In fact say he's known to per keys which
  are English words. Then a cryptanalyst can run through all English
  words as possible keys. This attack will often succeed, and it's much
  faster than a brute-force search of the entire keyspace.

  We can measure how bad a key  is by calculating its
  entropy. This number E is the number of ``real bits of information''
  of the key: a cryptanalyst will typically happen across the key within
  2^E guesses. E is defined as the sum of -p_K log_2 p_K, where p_K is
  the probability of key K.

* How do I recover from lost passwords in WordPerfect?

  WordPerfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break.
  The method uses XOR with two repeating key streams: a typed password
  and a byte-wide counter initialized to 1+<the password length>. Full
  descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli
  [BER91].

  Chris Galas : ``Someone a back was looking for a way to
  decrypt WordPerfect document files and I  I have a solution. 
   is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South,
  Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will
  decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox
  files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices, but if you
   your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a
  call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files
  that have a 10 char or less pw key.''

* How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?

  A repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the
  plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on), is called a Vigenere cipher.
  If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English, do the
  following: 

  1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.
  (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of
  the ciphertext against itself, count  bytes which are equal. 
  If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something
  over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different
  key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes
  of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which
  indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.

  2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This
  removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. 
  English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of
  text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing
  plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact
  one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)

  If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a
  standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis
  texts show how to break . It's possible with  methods, in
  the hands of an expert, if 's only ten times as much text as key.
  See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].

* How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, , PEM, ...]

  Here's one popular method, using the des command:

    cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail

  Mean,  is a de jure Internet standard in the works called
  PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through
  1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.
   is a beta version of PEM  tested at the time of this
  writing.

   are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting
  mail: PGP and .  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own
  newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security..  Each has its own FAQ
  as well.

  PGP is most commonly used outside the USA  it uses the RSA algorithm
  without a license and RSA's patent is valid only (or at least primarily)
  in the USA.

   is most commonly used inside the USA  it uses the RSA which
  is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside
  the USA.

   both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of
  the message (PGP used IDEA;  uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the
  message key, they  be able to interoperate freely.  Although 
  have been repeated calls for each to understand the other's formats and
  algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as
  we know).

* Is the UNIX crypt command secure?

  No. See [REE84].  is a program available called cbw (crypt
  breaker's workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks
  on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].

* How do I use compression with encryption?

  A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by
  some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).

  Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact
   of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it's
  impossible to describe ``the typical English text'' beyond coarse
  characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up
  more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy
  has a slightly more accurate model, he'll be able to find some
  redundancy in your compressed output.

  Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they
  have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that
  actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of
  UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number''
  that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.
  
  This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a
  bad idea; it just has to be done very, very caully, and by no 
  removes the need for strong encryption.

  Compression after encryption is silly.

* Is  an unbreakable cipher?

  Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the
  one-time pad requires secure  of as much key material as
  plaintext.

  Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be
  useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by
  likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is
  expected to remain valid.

* What does ``random'' mean in cryptography?

  Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom
  number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be
  cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to
  predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of
  the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of
  0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.

  A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function
  of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently
  random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by
  the opponent.  Ideally, it  also be truly random (perhaps
  generated by a hardware random number source).

   who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,
  generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of
  entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,

	cat /dev/audio | compress - >foo

  gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in
  it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,
  for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random
  string.

  When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is
  important  to measure the entropy rather than just assume that
  because it looks complicated to a human, it must be "random".  For
  example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be
  unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a
  clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.

* What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?

  See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount
  of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in
  the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number
  of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this
  can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to
  back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis. 
  Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have
  multiple, equally valid decryptions and theore to gain security
  from the opponent's difficulty choosing the correct one.

  Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic
  measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives
  probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext
  for which it is likely that  is only a single intelligible
  plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys
  are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists  normally
  deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine
  the likelihood of events of interest.

  Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than
  D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then  is not
  enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of
  possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,
  which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to
  8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but
  the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work
  required to find the key after approximately D characters have been
  intercepted.

  In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the  used
  in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key
  size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if
  it's too small, but doesn't guarantee security if it's high.) Few
  practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all
  manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges'' to crack
  some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic
  considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a
  recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.
  Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and
  information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most
  promising directions.

  Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information
  statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal
  1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the
  possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].

* What is key management and why is it important?

  One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in
  full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,
  and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of
  course, one  assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling
  Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)
  Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can
  eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in
  modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are
  transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but
  also enough key material to cover the traffic.

  Key management ers to the , authentication, and
  handling of keys.

  A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology
  is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use
  employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys'' and a central Key
  Management Center operated by NSA.  is a hierarchy in that
  certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control
  personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and
  to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the
  reporting of lost CIKs.

  This  give an inkling of the extent of the key management
  problem. For public-key systems,  are several related issues,
  many having to do with ``whom do you trust?''

* Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?

  Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from
  relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a
  linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random
  number generators, where  is no obvious dependence between seeds
  and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a
  high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically
  this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for
  cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more
  complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---
  but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable
  structure at all.

  See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89].

* What is the correct frequency list for English letters?

   are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than
  the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:
  namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of
  English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly'' computed,
  but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.

  The second answer is that the question doesn't make sense. What do
  you mean by ``English letters''? The ``English language'' is not a
  fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It
  has changed over time; it is different between different authors.
  Any particular message will have different statistics from  of
  the language as a whole.

  The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have
  exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all
  reasonable statistical uses  slight discrepancies won't matter.
  In fact 's an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics'' (other
  buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods'' and ``maximum likelihood
  estimation'') which studies questions like ``What's the chance that a
  text with  letter frequencies is in English?'' and comes up with
  reasonably robust answers.

  So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will
  be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.

* What is the Enigma?

  ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of
  information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by
  the British during WWII.''

  See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].

* How do I shuffle cards?

  Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of
  values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output
  permutations of this process  be equally likely.  To do this, you
  need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly
  distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that
  function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH
  is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two
  addresses given)

  for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;

  modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) 
  ranno()'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the
  error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()'s
  modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less
  than y, go back and get another ranno() value.


* Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?

  Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with
  possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted
  separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps
  even good for only a limited period of time) in  to avoid piracy.

  As far as we know, this is impossible,   is nothing in standard
  PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the
  keyboard.  If  were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be
  encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in
  part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one
  of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.

  If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced,  must
  be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in
  the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM's data.
  The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the
  illegal copy.


* Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?

  Utah sells products that break the password scheme of a number of
  popular Macintosh and PC software packages.   telephone number
  is (801) 224-6970

* What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?

  The story begins: When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted
  acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. So he replaced every A
  by a C, every B by a D, and so on through the alphabet. Only someone
  who knew the ``shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages.

  A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so
  that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is
  the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art
  of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when
  you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both
  cryptography and cryptanalysis.

  The original message is called a plaintext. The disguised message is
  called a ciphertext. Encryption  any procedure to convert
  plaintext into ciphertext. Decryption  any procedure to convert
  ciphertext into plaintext.

  A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The
  algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance,
  Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different
  values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here.

  The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are
  called recipients. Other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,
  eavesdroppers, or third parties.

* What  can I start with to learn cryptology?

  For an introduction to technical matter, the survey  given
  in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are, in general,
  concise, authored by competent people, and well written. However,
    are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has
  developed in the last 50 years or so, and are more abstract and
  mathematical than historical. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is
  encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up
  to the mid-60's.

  Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or
  Sinkov [SIN66]. This is recommended especially for people who want
  to devise  own encryption algorithms  it is a common
  mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one.

  The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of
  many public researchers to problems in cryptology. Consequently
  several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. The
  book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range
  of security including encryption algorithms, database security,
  access control, and formal models of security. Similar comments
  apply to the books of Price & Davies [PRI84] and Pfleeger [PFL89].

  The books of Konheim [KON81] and Meyer & Matyas [MEY82] are quite
  technical books. Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in
  the development of DES, and both books give a thorough analysis of
  DES. Konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses
  of many classical cryptosystems. Meyer and Matyas concentrate on
  modern cryptographic methods, especially pertaining to key management
  and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and
  networks.

  The books of Rueppel [RUE86] and Koblitz [KOB89] concentrate on
  the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography.

* How does one go about cryptanalysis?

  Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of
  analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools, pattern
  finding, patience, determination, and luck. The best available
  textbooks on the  are the Military Cryptanalytics series
  [FRIE1]. It is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is, for
  the most part, gained through the attempted solution of given
  systems. Such experience is considered so valuable that some of the
  cryptanalyses performed during WWII by the Allies are 
  classified.

  Modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer,
  or taking a discrete logarithm.  are not the traditional fare
  of the cryptanalyst. Computational number theorists are some of the
  most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems.

* What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?

  In a nutshell: If f(x) = y and you know y and can compute f, you can
  find x by trying every possible x. That's brute-force search.

  Example: Say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding
  ciphertext, but doesn't know the key. He can simply try encrypting the
  plaintext using each possible key, until the ciphertext matches---or
  decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext, whichever is faster.
  Every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this
  brute-force search is impractical.
    
  Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered
  practical. For example, DES, which has been in use for over 10 years
  now, has 2^56, or about 10^17, possible keys. A computation with
  this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the
  mid-70's. The situation is very different today given the dramatic
  decrease in cost per processor operation. Massively parallel
  machines threaten the security of DES against brute force search.
  Some scenarios are described by Garron and Outerbridge [GAR91].

  One phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a
  brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities.

* What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?

  The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key
  rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret.

  A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above.  The
  unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of
  ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and
  if for some key, the unicity distance is much longer than the amount
  of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key, the system is
  probably strong.

  A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears
  random to all standard statistical tests (see, for example, [CAE90]).
    
  A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. A
  system which has never been ed to scrutiny is suspect.

  If a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily
  strong? Certainly not. Many weak cryptosystems looked good at first.
  However, sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is
  strong by mathematical proof. ``If Joe can break this system, then
  he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring
  integers.'' See part 6.  Failing that, it's a crap shoot.

* If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it
  guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?

  Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical
  cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your
  ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. For instance, he might
  assume ``cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. If the crib is
  correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the
  rest of the message. Or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same
  plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. Thus
  he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he
  doesn't have a chance.

  Sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused. The one-time pad,
  for example, loses all security if it is used more than once! Even
  chosen-plaintext attacks, where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into
  the encryptor until he can deduce the key, have been employed. See
  [KAH67].
  
* Why are many people  using cryptosystems that are
  relatively easy to break?

  Some  know any better. Often amateurs  they can design
  secure systems, and are not aware of what an expert cryptanalyst
  could do. And sometimes  is insufficient motivation for anybody
  to invest the work needed to crack a system.

Here's a simple way to convert the  proposal to an unexceptionable
one: Make it voluntary.

That is--you get high quality secure NSA classified technology if you agree
to  your key. Otherwise you are on your own.

Getting the   to reveal the key *also* makes decipherable
all *past* conversations (which may be on tape, or disk, or whatver),
as I understand the proposal. I could be wrong, but I've seen no
mention of "session keys"  the ed entities.

As the EFF noted, this raises further issues about the fruits of one
bust leading to incrimination in other areas.

But is it any worse than the current unsecure system? It becomes much
worse, of course, if the government then uses this "Clinton "
to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption. (This is the main
concern of most of us, I . The camel's nose in the tent, etc.)

And it may also become much worse if the ostensible security is
increased, thus allowing greater access to "central office" records by
the government (the conversations  encrypted, who will object to
letting the government have access to them, perhaps even automatically
archiving large fractions...). This was one of the main objections to
the S.266 proposal, that it  force telecom suppliers to provide
easy access for the government.

One the government has had access to months or years of your encrypted
conversations, now all it takes is one misstep, one violation that
gets them the paperwork needed to decrypt *all* of them!

Do we want anyone to have this kind of power?

* What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?

  Read news.announce.newusers and news.answers for a few weeks. Always
  make sure to read a newsgroup for some time before you post to it.
  You'll be amazed how often the same question can be asked in the same
  newsgroup. After a month you'll have a much better sense of what the
  readers want to see.

* Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?

  No. In fact some  (notably misc.legal.computing) were
  created exactly so that political questions like `` RSA be
  patented?''  get in the way of technical discussions. Many
  sci.crypt readers also read misc.legal.computing, comp.org.eff.talk,
  comp.patents, sci.math, comp.compression, et al.; for the benefit of
  people who  care about  other topics, try to put your
  postings in the right group.

  Questions about microfilm and smuggling and other non-cryptographic
  ``spy stuff''  belong in sci.crypt either.

* How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?

  ``I just came up with this neat method of encryption. Here's some
  ciphertext: FHDSIJOYW^&%$*#@OGBUJHKFSYUIRE. Is it strong?'' Without a
  doubt questions like this are the most annoying traffic on sci.crypt.

  If you have come up with an encryption scheme, providing some
  ciphertext from it is not adequate. Nobody has ever been impressed by
  random gibberish. Any new algorithm  be secure even if the
  opponent knows the full algorithm (including how any message key is
  distributed) and only the private key is kept secret.  are some
  systematic and unsystematic ways to take reasonably long ciphertexts
  and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm, but
  this is a time-consuming and possibly fruitless exercise which most
  sci.crypt readers won't bother with.

  So what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme? First of all,
  find out if it's  new. Look through this FAQ for  and
  related methods. Familiarize yourself with the literature and the
  introductory textbooks.

  When you can appreciate how your cryptosystem fits into the world at
  large, try to break it yourself! You n't waste the time of tens
  of thousands of readers asking a question which you could have easily
  answered on your own.

  If you   your system is secure, and you want to get some
  reassurance from experts, you might try posting full details of your
  system, including working code and a solid theoretical explanation, to
  sci.crypt. (Keep in mind that the export of cryptography is regulated
  in some areas.)

  If you're lucky an expert might take some interest in what you posted.
  You can encourage this by offering cash rewards---for instance, noted
  cryptographer Ralph Merkle is offering $1000 to anyone who can break
  Snefru-4---but  are no guarantees. If you  have enough
  experience, then most likely any experts who look at your system will
  be able to find a flaw. If this happens, it's your responsibility to
  consider the flaw and learn from it, rather than just add one more
  layer of complication and come back for another round.

  A different way to get your cryptosystem reviewed is to have the NSA
  look at it. A full discussion of this procedure is outside the scope
  of this FAQ.

  Among professionals, a common rule of thumb is that if you want to
  design a cryptosystem, you have to have experience as a cryptanalyst.

* What is a product cipher?

  A product cipher is a block cipher that iterates several weak
  operations such as substitution, transposition, modular
  addition/multiplication, and linear transformation. (A ``block
  cipher'' just  a cipher that encrypts a block of data---8 bytes,
  say---all at once, then goes on to the next block.) The notion of
  product ciphers is due to Shannon [SHA49]. Examples of modern
  product ciphers include LUCIFER [SOR84], DES [NBS77], SP-networks
  [KAM78], LOKI [BRO90], FEAL [SHI84], PES [LAI90], Khufu and Khafre
  [ME91a]. The so-called Feistel ciphers are a class of product
  ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round,
  and then swap the ciphertext halves after each round. LUCIFER,
  DES, LOKI, and FEAL are examples of Feistel ciphers.

  The following table compares the main parameters of several product 
  ciphers:

  cipher   |   block length   |   key bits   |   number of rounds
  LUCIFER          128               128                16
  DES               64                56                16
  LOKI              64                64                16
  FEAL              64               128            2^x, x >= 5
  PES               64               128                 8

* What makes a product cipher secure?

  Nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is
  completely secure. So in practice one begins by demonstrating that the
  cipher ``looks highly random''. For example, the cipher must be
  nonlinear, and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends
  on every bit of the plaintext and the key. Meyer [MEY78] has shown
  that at least 5 rounds of DES are required to guarantee such a
  dependence. In this sense a product cipher  act as a ``mixing''
  function which combines the plaintext, key, and ciphertext in a
  complex nonlinear fashion.

  The fixed per-round substitutions of the product cipher are
  erred to as S-boxes. For example, LUCIFER has 2 S-boxes, and DES
  has 8 S-boxes. The nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a
  caul design of  S-boxes. A list of partial design criteria
  for the S-boxes of DES, which apply to S-boxes in general, may be
  found in Brown [BRO89] and Brickell et al. [BRI86].

* What are some group-theoretic properties of product ciphers?

  Let E be a product cipher that maps N-bit blocks to N-bit blocks.
  Let E_K(X) be the encryption of X under key K. Then, for any fixed K,
  the map sending X to E_K(X) is a permutation of the set of N-bit
  blocks. Denote this permutation by P_K. The set of all N-bit
  permutations is called the symmetric group and is written S_{2^N}.
  The collection of all  permutations P_K, where K ranges over all
  possible keys, is denoted E(S_{2^N}). If E were a random mapping from
  plaintexts to ciphertexts then we  expect E(S_{2^N}) to generate
  a large subset of S_{2^N}.

  Coppersmith and Grossman [COP74] have shown that a very simple
  product cipher can generate the alternating group A_{2^N} given a
  sufficient number of rounds. (The alternating group is half of the
  symmetric group: it consists of all ``even'' permutations, i.e., all
  permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps.)
  Even and Goldreich [EVE83] were able to extend  results to show
  that Feistel ciphers can generate A_{2^N}, given a sufficient number
  of rounds.

  The security of multiple encipherment also depends on the
  group-theoretic properties of a cipher. Multiple encipherment is an
  extension over single encipherment if for keys K1, K2  does
  not exist a third key K3 such that

  E_K2(E_K1(X)) == E_(K3)(X)                (**)

  which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys
  K1, K2 is equal to a single encryption under the third key K3.  If
  for every K1, K2  exists a K3 such that eq. (**) is true then
  we say that E is a group.

  This question of whether DES is a group under this definition was
  extensively studied by Sherman, Kaliski, and Rivest [SHE88]. In 
  paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that DES is not a
  group. In fact DES is not a group [CAM93].

* What can be proven about the security of a product cipher?

  Recall from above that P_K is a permutation produced by E under
  some key K. The goal of the designer of E is to ensure that P_K
  appears to be a random element of S_{2^N}, the symmetric group.
  Let R be an element of S_{2^N} selected randomly. We will say that P_K
  and R are indistinguishable if an observer given P_K and R in some
   cannot distinguish between  two permutations in polynomial
  time. That is, with time bounded resources, the observer cannot
  determine which of the permutations is produced by E: the optimal
  decision is no better than simply guessing.

  Luby and Rackoff [LUB88] have shown that a class of Feistel ciphers
  are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by
  random boolean functions.

* How are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size?

   are four standard "modes of operation" (and numerous non-standard
  ones as well).  The standard modes of operation are defined in the U.S.
  Department of Commerce Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 81,
  published in 1980.  See the question about "ECB" below for more details.

  Although they are defined for the DES block cipher, the "modes of
  operation" can be used with any block cipher.

* Can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication?

  One may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself
  that he did or did not generate a message, and to prove to himself 
  whether his message was altered or unaltered  generation.  But one
  cannot prove  things to another without revealing the key, and 
  after that key cannot be used to prove anything about any messages
  that were authenticated using that key.
  
  See ANSI X3.106-1983 and FIPS 113 (1985) for a standard method of message
  authentication using DES.

* What exactly is DES?

  DES is the U.S. Government's Data Encryption Standard - a product 
  cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks of data, using a 56-bit key.  

  It is defined in FIPS 46-1 (1988) [which supersedes FIPS 46 (1977)].
  FIPS are Federal Information Processing Standards published by NTIS.
  DES is identical to the ANSI standard Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA)
  defined in ANSI X3.92-1981. 

* What is triple DES?

  Triple DES is a product cipher which, like DES, operates on 64-bit 
  data blocks.   are several forms, each of which uses the DES
  cipher 3 times.  Some forms use two 56-bit keys, some use three.
  The "DES modes of operation" may also be used with triple-DES.

  Some people er to E(K1,D(K2,E(K1,x))) as triple-DES.

  This method is defined in chapter 7.2 of the ANSI standard X9.17-1985
  "Financial Institution Key Management" and is intended for use in
  encrypting DES keys and IVs for "Automated Key ".  Its
  formal name is "Encryption and Decryption of a Single Key by a Key
  Pair", but it is erenced in other standards documents as EDE.

  That standard says (section 7.2.1): "Key encrypting keys may be a single
  DEA key or a DEA key pair.  Key pairs shoud be used where additional
  security is needed (e.g., the data protected by the key(s) has a long
  security life).  A key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a
  single key."

  Others use the term "triple-DES" for E(K1,D(K2,E(K3,x))) or
  E(K1,E(K2,E(K3,x))).

  One of us (Carl Ellison) keeps advocating DES triple use in the form
  E(K1, TRAN( E(K2, TRAN( E(K3, COMPRESS( x )))))), where each DES instance
  has its own key and IV (for CBC mode) and TRAN has been posted on
  sci.crypt.  (It is a large-block transposition program taking its key
  from the data stream itself, so that it is not an encryption program on
  its own part.)

* What is differential cryptanalysis?

  Differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be
  applied to any iterated mapping (ie. any mapping which is based on
  a repeated round function). The method was recently popularized by
  Biham and Shamir [BIH91], but Coppersmith has remarked that the
  S-boxes of DES were optimized against this attack some 20 years ago.
  This method has proved effective against several product ciphers,
  notably FEAL [BI91a].

  Differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of
  ciphertexts Y, Y' whose corresponding plaintexts X, X' satisfy a
  known difference D = X+X', where + is componentwise XOR. In the
  basic Biham-Shamir attack, 2^{47} such plaintext pairs are required
  to determine the key for DES. Substantially fewer pairs are required
  if DES is truncated to 6 or 8 rounds. In  cases, the actual key
  can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs.
  For full DES this attack is impractical because it requires so many
  known plaintexts.

  The work of Biham and Shamir on DES revealed several startling
  observations on the algorithm. Most importantly, if the key
  schedule was removed from DES and a 16*48 = 768-bit key was used,
  the key could be recovered in less than 2^{64} steps. Thus
  independent subkeys do not add substantial security to DES.
  Further, the S-boxes of DES are extremely sensitive in that
  changing even single entries in  tables yields significant
  improvement in the differential attack.

  Adi Shamir is quoted to say (NYTimes Oct 13 1991), ``I  say
  that, contrary to what some people believe,  is no evidence
  of tampering with the DES so that the basic design was weakened.''

* How was NSA involved in the design of DES?

  According to Kinnucan [KIN78], Tuchman, a member of the group that
  developed DES at IBM is quoted as saying, ``We developed the DES
  algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers. The NSA did not
  dictate a single wire!'' Tuchman and Meyer (another developer of
  DES) spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in
  Lucifer. They then spent two years strengthening Lucifer. ``
  basic approach was to look for strong substitution, permutation,
  and key scheduling functions ... IBM has classified the notes
  containing the selection criteria at the request of the NSA....
  `The NSA told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep
  secrets it uses to make its own algorithms,' explains Tuchman.''
  
  On the other hand, a document called ``Involvement of the NSA in
  the development of DES: unclassified summary of the United States
  Select Committee on Intelligence'', printed in the IEEE
  Communications Magazine, p53-55, 1978, states: ``In the development
  of DES, NSA convinced IBM that a reduced keysize was sufficient;
  indirectly assisted in the development of the S-box structures; and
  certified that the final DES algorithm was, to the best of 
  knowledge, free from any statistical or mathematical weakness.''

  Clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the NSA.
  The  further states that the NSA did not tamper with the
  algorithm itself, just the parameters, which in some sense
  resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of Meyer and Tuchman
  presented above.

* Is DES available in software?

  Several people have made DES code available via ftp (see part 10 for
  pathnames): Stig Ostholm [FTPSO]; BSD [FTPBK]; Eric Young [FTPEY];
  Dennis Furguson [FTPDF]; Mark Riordan [FTPMR]; Phil Karn [FTPPK].
  A Pascal listing of DES is also given in Patterson [PAT87].

  FIPS 46-1 says "The algorithm specified in this standard is to be
  implemented ... using hardware (not software) technology.  ...
  Software implementations in general purpose computers are not in
  compliance with this standard."  Despite this, software
  implementations abound, and are used by government agencies.

* Is DES available in hardware?

  The following paragraphs are quoted from messages sent to the editors.
  We  vouch for the quality or even existence of the products.

  Chip Rosenthal says: ``Dallas Semiconductor makes a DES
  encryption/decryption device for use on standard, digital 64Kbps PCM
  telecom data streams. It is capable of processing data in real time,
  e.g. one sample/frame. It is the DS2160.  phone number is
  214-450-0400. You  probably need to talk with Dewight in Telecom
  marketing.''

  Christian Franke, franke@informatik.rwth-aachen.de, says: ``1.
  Cryptech CRY12C102: 22.5Mbit/s according to Data Sheet, with 32 Bit
  interface. We use this one, because it was the only one available when
  we started the project. No problems !  2. Pijnenburg PCC100: 20Mbit/s
  according to Data Sheet. Address: PIJNENBURG B.V., Boxtelswweg 26,
  NL-5261 NE Vught, The Netherlands.  3. INFOSYS DES Chip (Germany):
  S-Boxes must be loaded by software. So you can modify the Algorithm.
  Sorry, I  have the data sheet handy. Please E-Mail me if you need
  further information.''

  DES or Public Key ICs then Timestep Engineering developed
  Newbridge's crypto chips and ICs for other commercial and
  educational establishments. They can be reached at (613) 820-0024.

* Can DES be used to protect classified information?

  DES is not intended to protect classified data.  FIPS 46-1 says:
  "This standard will be used by Federal departments and agencies for
  the cryptographic protection of computer data when the following
  conditions apply: 1.  ...  cryptographic protection is required; and
  2. the data is not classified according to the National Security Act
  of 1947, as amended, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended."

* What are "ECB", "CBC", "CFB", and "OFB" encryption?

   are methods for using block ciphers, such as DES, to encrypt 
  messages, files, and blocks of data, known as "modes of operation."
  Four "modes of operation" are defined in FIPS 81 (1980 December 2), 
  and also in ANSI X3.106-1983.   

  FIPS 81 specifies that when 7-bit ASCII data is sent in octets, the
  unused most-significant bit is to be set to 1.
  FIPS 81 also specifies the padding for short blocks.

  The four DES modes of operation are: 
	Electronic Code Book  (ECB), 
	Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), 
	K-bit Cipher FeedBack (CFB), and 
	K-bit Output FeedBack (OFB).

   methods are explained below in a c-language-like notation.

  Some symbols:

  P[n]	The n'th block of plaintext, input to encryption, output from
  	decryption.  Size of block determined by the mode.

  C[n]	The n'th block of ciphertext, output from encryption, input to
  	decryption.  Size of block determined by the mode.

  E(m)	The DES encryption function, performed on 64-bit block m, using
  	the 16-key schedule derived from some 56-bit key.

  D(m)	The DES decryption function, performed on 64-bit block m, using
  	the same key schedule as in E(m), except that the 16 keys
  	in the schedule are used in the opposite  as in E(m).

  IV	A 64-bit "initialization vector", a secret value which, along with
  	the key, is shared by both encryptor and decryptor.

  I[n]	The n'th value of a 64-bit variable, used in some modes.
  R[n]	The n'th value of a 64-bit variable, used in some modes.

  LSB(m,k) The k least significant (right-most) bits of m.
  	e.g.  m & ((1 << k) - 1)

  MSB(m,k) The k most significant (left-most) bits of m.
  	e.g.  (m >> (64-k)) & ((1 << k) - 1)

  = ^ << >> &  operators as defined in the c langage.


  Electronic Code Book (ECB):

  	  P[n] and C[n] are each 64-bits long.

  	  Encryption:			Decryption:
  	  C[n] = E(P[n])		P[n] = D(C[n])


  Cipher Block Chaining (CBC):

  	  P[n] and C[n] are each 64-bits long.

  	  Encryption:			Decryption:
  	  C[0] = E(P[0]^IV)		P[0] = D(C[0])^IV
  (n>0)	  C[n] = E(P[n]^C[n-1])		P[n] = D(C[n])^C[n-1]


  k-bit Cipher FeedBack (CFB):

  	  P[n] and C[n] are each k bits long, 1 <= k <= 64.  

  	  Encryption:			Decryption:
  	  I[0] = IV			I[0] = IV
  (n>0)	  I[n] = I[n-1]<<k | C[n-1]	I[n] = I[n-1]<<k | C[n-1]	
  (all n) R[n] = MSB(E(I[n]),k)		R[n] = MSB(E(I[n]),k)
  (all n) C[n] = P[n]^R[n]		P[n] = C[n]^R[n]

  	  Note that for k==64, this reduces to:

  	  I[0] = IV			I[0] = IV
  (n>0)	  I[n] = C[n-1]			I[n] = C[n-1]	
  (all n) R[n] = E(I[n])		R[n] = E(I[n])
  (all n) C[n] = P[n]^R[n]		P[n] = C[n]^R[n]

  CFB notes:  I[n] depends only on the plain or cipher text from the
  previous operation, the E() function can be performed in parallel with
  the reception of the text with which it is used.


  k-bit Output FeedBack (OFB):

  	  P[n] and C[n] are each k bits long, 1 <= k <= 64.  

  	  Encryption:			Decryption:
  	  I[0] = IV			I[0] = IV
  (n>0)	  I[n] = I[n-1]<<k | R[n-1]	I[n] = I[n-1]<<k | R[n-1]	
  (all n) R[n] = MSB(E(I[n]),k)		R[n] = MSB(E(I[n]),k)
  (all n) C[n] = P[n]^R[n]		P[n] = C[n]^R[n]

  	  Note that for k==64, this reduces to:

  	  I[0] = IV			I[0] = IV
  (n>0)	  I[n] = R[n-1]			I[n] = R[n-1]	
  (all n) R[n] = E(I[n])		R[n] = E(I[n])
  (all n) C[n] = P[n]^R[n]		P[n] = C[n]^R[n]

  OFB notes: encryption and decryption are identical.   I[n] is
  independent of P and C, the E() function can be performed in advance of
  the receipt of the plain/cipher text with which it is to be used.


  Additional notes on DES "modes of operation":

  ECB and CBC use E() to encrypt and D() to decrypt, but the feedback modes
  use E() to both encrypt and decrypt.  This disproves the erroneous claim
  that systems which feature E() but not D() cannot be used for data
  confidentiality, and theore are not  to export controls.

* What is public-key cryptography?

  In a classic cryptosystem, we have encryption functions E_K and
  decryption functions D_K such that D_K(E_K(P)) = P for any plaintext
  P. In a public-key cryptosystem, E_K can be easily computed from some
  ``public key'' X which in turn is computed from K. X is published, so
  that anyone can encrypt messages. If D_K cannot be easily computed
  from X, then only the person who generated K can decrypt messages.
  That's the essence of public-key cryptography, published by Diffie
  and Hellman in 1976.

  In a classic cryptosystem, if you want your friends to be able to
  send secret messages to you, you have to make sure nobody other than
  them sees the key K. In a public-key cryptosystem, you just publish X,
  and you  have to worry about spies.

  This is only the beginning of public-key cryptography.  is an
  extensive literature on security models for public-key cryptography,
  applications of public-key cryptography, other applications of the
  mathematical technology behind public-key cryptography, and so on.

* What's RSA?

  RSA is a public-key cryptosystem defined by Rivest, Shamir, and
  Adleman.  For full details,  is a FAQ available by ftp at
  RSA.COM. Here's a small example.

  Plaintexts are positive integers up to 2^{512}. Keys are quadruples
  (p,q,e,d), with p a 256-bit prime number, q a 258-bit prime number,
  and d and e large numbers with (de - 1) divisible by (p-1)(q-1). We
  define E_K(P) = P^e mod pq, D_K(C) = C^d mod pq.

  Now E_K is easily computed from the pair (pq,e)---but, as far as
  anyone knows,  is no easy way to compute D_K from the pair
  (pq,e). So whoever generates K can publish (pq,e). Anyone can send a
  secret message to him; he is the only one who can read the messages.

* Is RSA secure?

  Nobody knows. An obvious attack on RSA is to factor pq into p and q.
  See below for comments on how fast state-of-the-art factorization
  algorithms run. Unfortunately nobody has the slightest idea how to
  prove that factorization---or any realistic problem at all, for that
  matter---is inherently slow. It is easy to formalize what we mean by
  ``RSA is/isn't strong''; but, as Hendrik W. Lenstra, Jr., says,
  ``Exact definitions appear to be necessary only when one wishes to
  prove that algorithms with certain properties do _not_ exist, and
  theoretical computer science is notoriously lacking in such negative
  results.''

* How fast can people factor numbers?

  It depends on the size of the numbers. In October 1992 Arjen Lenstra
  and Dan Bernstein factored 2^523 - 1 into primes, using about three
  weeks of MasPar time. (The MasPar is a 16384-processor SIMD machine;
  each processor can add about 200000 integers per second.) The
  algorithm  is called the ``number field sieve''; it is quite a
  bit faster for special numbers like 2^523 - 1 than for general numbers
  n, but it takes time only about exp(O(log^{1/3} n log^{2/3} log n)) in
  any case.

  An older and more popular method for smaller numbers is the ``multiple
  polynomial quadratic sieve'', which takes time exp(O(log^{1/2} n
  log^{1/2} log n))---faster than the number field sieve for small n,
  but slower for large n. The breakeven point is somewhere between 100
  and 150 digits, depending on the implementations.

  Factorization is a fast-moving field---the state of the art just a few
  years ago was nowhere near as good as it is now. If no new methods are
  developed, then 2048-bit RSA keys will always be safe from
  factorization, but one can't predict the future. (Before the number
  field sieve was found, many people conjectured that the quadratic
  sieve was asymptotically as fast as any factoring method could be.)

* What about other public-key cryptosystems?

  We've talked about RSA because it's well known and easy to describe.
  But  are lots of other public-key systems around, many of which
  are faster than RSA or depend on problems more widely believed to be
  difficult. This has been just a brief introduction; if you  want
  to learn about the many facets of public-key cryptography, consult the
  books and journal  listed in part 10.

FAQ for sci.crypt, part 7: Digital Signatures and Hash Functions

This is the seventh of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are
mostly independent, but you  read the first part before the rest.
We  have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so  ask.
Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' er to the erence list in the last part.

The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu 
as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography

every 21 days.


Contents:

* What is a one-way hash function?
* What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?
* What are MD4 and MD5?
* What is Snefru?


* What is a one-way hash function?

  A typical one-way hash function takes a variable-length message and
  produces a fixed-length hash. Given the hash it is computationally
  impossible to find a message with that hash; in fact one can't
  determine any usable information about a message with that hash, not
  even a single bit. For some one-way hash functions it's also
  computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the
  same hash.

  A one-way hash function can be private or public, just like an
  encryption function. Here's one application of a public one-way hash
  function, like MD5 or Snefru. Most public-key signature systems are
  relatively slow. To sign a long message may take longer than the user
  is willing to wait. Solution: Compute the one-way hash of the message,
  and sign the hash, which is short. Now anyone who wants to verify the
  signature can do the same thing.

  Another name for one-way hash function is message digest function.

* What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?

   is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a
  very small set of concepts. When an algorithm depends on a key which
  isn't published, we call it a private algorithm; otherwise we call it
  a public algorithm. We have encryption functions E and decryption
  functions D, so that D(E(M)) = M for any message M. We also have
  hashing functions H and verification functions V, such that V(M,X) = 1
  if and only if X = H(M).

  A public-key cryptosystem has public encryption and private
  decryption. Checksums, such as the application mentioned in the
  previous question, have public hashing and public verification.
  Digital signature functions have private hashing and public
  verification: only one person can produce the hash for a message,
  but everyone can verify that the hash is correct.

  Obviously, when an algorithm depends on a private key, it's meant to
  be unusable by anyone who doesn't have the key. 's no real
  difference between a ``shared'' key and a private key: a shared key
  isn't published, so it's private. If you encrypt data for a friend
  rather than ``for your eyes only'', are you suddenly doing
  ``shared-key encryption'' rather than private-key encryption? No.

* What are MD4 and MD5?

  MD4 and MD5 are message digest functions developed by Ron Rivest.
  Definitions appear in RFC 1320 and RFC 1321 (see part 10). Code is
  available from [FTPMD].

  Note that a transcription error was found in the original MD5 draft
  RFC. The corrected algorithm  be called MD5a, though some
  people er to it as MD5.

* What is Snefru?

  Snefru is a family of message digest functions developed by Ralph
  Merkle. Snefru-8 is an 8-round function, the newest in the family.
  Definitions appear in Merkle's paper [ME91a]. Code is available from
  [FTPSF].

* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?
* What are the US export regulations?
* What is TEMPEST?
* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?
* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?

* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?

  The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It
  was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40's, and
  has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is
  known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,
  and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the
  world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of
  cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many
  years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break
  many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national
  security almost all information about the NSA is classified.

  Bamford's book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of
  the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the
  difference between public and private research in cryptography:

  ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,
  one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted
  behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged
  today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of
   engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10
  years has  in fact been widespread open research in
  cryptology.  have been, and will continue to be, conflicts
  between  two research communities. Open research is common
  quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open
  exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in
  scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with
  responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,
  countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can
  a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might
  undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers?
  One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher 
  force all governments to behave like Stimson's `gentlemen', but one
  must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with
  political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most
  scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have
  occurred between government agencies and open researchers in
  cryptology, but rather that  conflicts (at least  of which
  we are aware) have been so few and so mild.''

* What are the US export regulations?

  In a nutshell,  are two government agencies which control
  export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export
  Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by
  the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office
  of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized
  by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule
  of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent
  requirements, but DTC (which takes s from NSA) wants to see
  everything first and can use to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.

  The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting
  discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what
  people  about  laws, and many other complex issues which
  go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to
  consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in
  jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at
  least heard of the ITAR.

* What is TEMPEST?

  TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer
  equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that
  information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at
  quite a distance and with little effort.

  Needless to say, encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext
  is available this way.

* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?

  (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for
  corrections.)

  The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas
  Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass
  of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving
  three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the
  location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.
  Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;
  it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the
  Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;
  many documents have been tried as the key to B1.

  Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various
   with an eye toward splitting the treasure:

  The Beale Cypher Association
  P.O. Box 975
  Beaver Falls, PA 15010

  You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the
  line:

  send index

  in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.
  ( are apparently several different versions of the cipher
  floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,
  says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)

  Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of
  problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI
  and found some unexpected strings, including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.
  Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this
  string couldn't appear by chance, but feels  must be an
  explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this
  string.

* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?

  The ACA is an  devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis
  on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with
  pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram'' includes
   and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in

Well, almost.... If I only had to solve the problem for myself, and were
willing to have to type in a second password (the secret key) whenever I
logged in, it could work. However, I'm trying to create a solution that
anyone can use, and which, once installed, is just as effortless to start up
as the non-solution of just using xhost(1) to control access. I've got
religeous problems with storing secret keys on multiuser computers.

Thanks for the pointer! It was good reading, and I liked the idea of using
several unrelated sources with a strong mixing function. However, unless I
missed something, the only source they suggested (aside from a hardware RNG)
that seems available, and unguessable by an intruder, when a Unix is
fresh-booted, is I/O buffers related to network traffic. I believe my
solution basically uses that strategy, without requiring me to reach into
the kernel.

I heard about this solution, and it sounded good. Then I heard that folks
were experiencing times of 30-60 seconds to run this, on
reasonably-configured workstations. I'm not willing to add that much delay
to someone's login process. My approach (etherfind|compress, skip 10K) takes
a second or two to run. I'm considering writing the be-all and end-all of
solutions, that launches the MD5, and simultaneously tries to suck bits off
the net, and if the net  be sitting __SO__ idle that it can't get 10K
after compression before MD5 finishes, use the MD5. This way I could have
guaranteed good bits, and a deterministic upper bound on login time, and
 have the common case of login take only a couple of extra seconds.

True in theory.  In practice?  The technology of cellular phones will
probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext
without the key.  If the frequency path depends on they key, as I
understand it to, it *could* be made effectively impossible to record.

Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  The
telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  That's the rule
today.

But even so, the evidence  not be admissible, I , unless the
judge so ed.  I  that even interception of the crypttext
without a warrant  be illegal.   Cops can't record today's plain
cellular calls and then ask a judge, "Hey, can we have permission to
listen to  tapes?" can they?

Yes, that is a major concern, but I  that they  they can
win just by having 99.5% of the USA use this system.  They  even
have to care about the cautious .5% that's left.  They  catch the
 smart crooks anyway.   John Gotti, who  have to be retarded
not to realize he was likely to be wiretapped, glibly chatted away
on his tapped phone about murder plans.  That's why he's in jail now.
Hard to believe, but true.


This scheme can succeed without laws forbidding more, which people 
fight a lot harder.  They like this enough that they are dropping the so
called "Digital Telephony" proposal, according to rumours.  However the
meaning of that is complex,  they  want to get at the crypttext
on telco systems, and that requires a bit of work.

  A remark I heard the other day is beginning to take on increasingly
frightening significance.  The comment was made that "In other parts
of the world the Democrats [note the big "D"]  be known as
Socialists" 

  A [note the small "d"] democrat who wonders what Thomas Jefferson, on
this the 250th anniversary of his birth,  have thought of the state
of affairs between the government and the governed.

   Clinton is just more clever than the other guy. Looks like gun control for

Remember "Defend Firearms - Defeat Dukakis", followed by Bush's soon-after-
election support for gun-control?   This is the Democrats' version
"Defend Free Speech - Reject Republicans" followed by speech control.

   Wait a minute....  Let me  about this.

   Hmmm, I feel better now. I believe the White House when they tell us

   They're here to help us.   God bless America.

Fascinating.  Most of the content of the White House announcements was
in what was *not* said.  It gives us almost nothing of value, threatens to
take away a lot, and does it with a re smile on its face,
and the nice friendly word "Management".

			      FACT SHEET
		     PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT

The first thing it doesn't say is "We're giving you stronger encryption".
what it says is 
   the U. S. Government has developed a microcircuit that not only
   provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust
   than the current government standard, but also permits ing of
   the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for the
   ing of keys will allow the government to gain access to
   encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization.
But DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now,
so the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break!
*At best* it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break,  they
need to get one of the two ed keys to do a brute-force search
for the other 40-bit key.

Similarly, it didn't say "We're making encryption is commercially available."
because encryption *is* already commercially available, including
forms the NSA may not be able to break, like triple-DES or IDEA.
And phone companies could offer DES-based systems *now* if they were
convinced the government  let them and they could make enough money.

The next thing it didn't say is "We're making encryption legal",
because of course encryption *has always been* legal, and the
President can't change the First Amendment merely by decree.
What it *did* say was:
	In making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the
	private sector from developing, or the government from approving,
	other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in
	assuring both privacy and a secure key-  system.
which clearly  "We're making encryption illegal unless we get your keys.
Soon.  Once business buys into this."

Another thing it didn't say is "We're going to ask Congress for money
to do *lots* more wiretapping", because of course, 's a budget crisis,
and Congress might debate the policy issues or not give them the cash.
What it *did* say was:
   The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to
   the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct
   lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure
   law enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General
   shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture
   Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase.
which  "We've got money Congress can't control and we're going to
buy lots of wiretapping equipment with it to detect NON-APPROVED CRYPTO
(that's what "preserve the government's ability to conduct ... surveillance" 
.)

Interestingly enough, in designing the , we may want to use some
rather unusual technology, such as sealed boxes of paper, or
destructive read memory, rather than typical computer databases, which
is fun for a database of hundreds of millions of keys.

The greatest danger of the  database, if it were kept on disk,
 be the chance that a complete copy could somehow leak out.  You
can design lots of protection, but with enough corruption a complete
copy is always possible.   Storing it on paper or something very hard
to copy at once may actually make sense.  Or a medium that can't be
copied -- for example, something with very slow access times or which
leaves a destructive trail if it is even read.

Of course then it's hard to backup.  However, I  the consequences
of no backup -- the data is not  when a warrant comes -- are worse
than the consequences of a secret backup.

An audit trail that reveals when data has been access, that *can't* be
erased by the humans involved, is also necessary.

Nice to , but naive.  The fact is that millions of people today
are sending highly confidential information over unencoded, easy to
receive cellular phones.  They figure the chances of  heard are
small, so they risk it.

And 99.9% of people  understand crypto the way the least of the
sci.crypt newbies does.   If Clinton tells them it's good crypto,
they'll believe him, and send important stuff over it, and be thankful
that they're no longer using clear-voice FM cellular phones.

Only a tiny fraction of people will want more crypto.  Worse, in the
eyes of the government, which swears up and down the algorithim is
spook-level secure (and it may indeed be) the only reason you could
possibly want this extra level is to avoid police.

By using it, you'll attract attention as a likely lawbreaker.

"Your honour, the suspect suddenly started using another level of
cryptography and we can't tap his phone calls any more.  He must
have something to hide.  Please sign the warrant to search his
house..."

Excuse me?  This has *already* happened.  's a couple of humps in

I suggest that you rain from such insults unless and until you can
produce some evidence to back up that claim.  Given the measures proposed
or passed in the last year or so, such as S.266 and the scanner ban,
her proposal need not be any more than her own attempt at a technical
solution.  It's entirely possible, in fact, that it was the notion of
splitting the key, which came up in the debate, that softened this proposal.

53 seconds to hash 20M of core (I bet I know who the source of your
information is!). No, it's not acceptable if it's part of your login
process. But if you are going to use network traffic as the source of
pseudo-random information, do the right thing and pass it through a
cryptographic hash function, not a compressor. Aside from the fact
that it will run faster, it will give better results ( of a
cryptographic hash as a function that "dis" randomness).
Something along the  of 
	etherfind -t -x -n  | dd bs=1k count=10 2>/dev/null | md5
 do the trick. -t gives you timestamps, and the lack of -u makes
sure that dd does not get ten  as opposed to ten K. The above
takes a couple of seconds on a lightly-loaded ethernet.

Lets hope. Years ago a Telecom tech used to tap a line unless he saw the 
warrant. The managment type who told him to do it fired him. The appeal
against the dismissal was lost.

I have a question about digital communications encryption:

	The Fact Sheet mentioned encryption/decryption microcircuitry with 
special "keys" for law enforcement for wire tapping purposes.

	If I wanted to, couldn't I develop  encryption of my own?  That
is, if me and a partner in crime had unique Encryption/decryption
devices installed before the "tappable" one, couldn't we circumvent
the "keys" system?  Or replace it?

	I'd be  interested in knowing how the E/D microcircuits might
be made to prevent such befuddlement! (Laymans' Language, please! maybe a bit
technical...)

Please E-mail to me, as I'm not in Net News as much as I'd like to be!

Under the relevant federal law, 18 USC sec. 2518(8)(d), the
authorizing judge must notify the targets within 90 days after the tap
period (with extensions) expires.  This is the "normal" practice.

Of course, no wiretap law  be complete without the Unless Clause,
which in subsection 8(d) reads like this: "On an ex parte showing
[i.e., by the gov't without opposition,  that  obviously
involve notice to the targets] of good cause to a judge of competent
jurisdiction the serving of the inventory required by this subsection
[the  itself; dates of interception; etc.] *may be postponed*"
(emphasis added).

Encrypting just the radio link doesn't make sense to me.  That  the telco
has to do the decryption, and hence they need the keys.  How are they going to be

in Siberia for not turning in our Captain Crunch Secret Decoder Rings.

	Surely the hypothesis relying on the least wild assumptions is
to take this at face value. Our lads at the fort were asked to cook up
something that's pretty secure, with a key that can be ed neatly,
and they did. The government plans to sell this thing, for the reasons
they state. Yes,  evil guys in the FBI can probably, with some
effort, abuse the system. I got news for you, if the evil guys in
the FBI decide they want to persecute you, they're gonna, and you're
gonna hate it. Fact is, the FBI doesn't want to listen to your phone
calls, and if they do, and if you're using triple-DES, they'll just
get a parabolic microphone and point it at your head.

	This is pretty clearly an effort by the government to do exactly
what they're saying they're doing. As is typical with governments,
it's mismanaged, and full of holes and compromises. As is typical
with our government, it's not too bad, could be worse.

	My interpretation.

A Unix tool of cryptographic significance is available
for anonymous ftp.

"agrep 2.0.4" -- a fast approximate pattern-matching tool

source code project available from:

cs.arizona.edu 

in directory "agrep"

agrep is a very fast fuzzy search tool with a tremendous
number of powerful search options.  The one most obviously
applicable to cryptography (key selection) is to be able to
specify the "similarity" of matches in the data.

For example say you make up a password/phrase of "qimwe7l".
Of course you rightly suspect that this key itself is not
in any dictionary or word list.  But how *close* is it to
en entry that could be varied by some "crack" program to
brute-force search for it?

You use agrep to find out.  Looking with argument for none,
one or two errors, no matches.  Good so far.  But 

agrep -3 "qimwe7l" bigwordandphraselist

finds that the pattern "qimwe7l" is too close to the
pattern "imsel" (part of "himself" and a host of others),
to be of any cryptographic value as a key.

An error of level two corresponds to a simple transposition of
letters like "teh" for "the".  A minimally acceptable password
 have to pass as *least* level 3 in  not immediately
ruled-out as even a remote possibility of  a good password.
(In real cryptographic use, my personal passphrases clear at
*least* level 8 on my rather large [>80 meg] word and phrase lists.)


And for searching for key words in human-typed data (lots o'
typos) the tool is unexcelled.  For example, For example,
say I want to find out what people  about Gibson's
SF book "Neuromancer" in the huge SF-Lover's archives.
Even with an error distance specification as small as
of "1" I will find all  people who  the title
was "Necromancer" or other common typos.  Why miss anything?

Also, the program can look for up to 30,000 patterns IN PARALLEL
at Boyer-Moore (sublinear) speeds.  Great for a NSA wannabe
to look for your name, terrorists names, special Tagalog or
religious words, etc. in the news or e-mail spool directories.

You can even search for ciphertext by using, say, 30,000
random three-byte combinations and eliminate all texts that
 score the X chi-square 'birthday' hits on message size Y.

You  some crypto-terrorist is try to foil you by changing
the pattern on you?  No problem.  Try agrep -p NSA to find
NSA, National Security Agency, NSecAg, No Such Agency,
National Scrabble Association, N*S*A, etc.

You can also specify "fixed" areas: looking for license
plate XYZ123 when you know that the letters are correct,
you might say:

agrep -2 <XYZ>123 licenseplatedatabase

will find all plates starting with XYZ with up to two errors
(addition, substitution, deletion) in the number area.  You can
also "weight" the relative "cost" for substiutions, additions,
or deletion errors.  For example, when searching DNA patterns
for a particular protein combination, you might know that
some kinds of damage cause the "A" nucelotide to drop out more
than other errors... you could adjust for this bias by setting
-Dc where you set the "deletion cost" to count as "c" errors.

A steganographic use (I even used "agrep -2 "<steg>eograp" E"
just now to find the correct spelling!)  be to intentionally
introduce errors of a certain type and magnitude into a plaintext
and then later recover the orginal it via an agrep pipe.  Lots of
possibilities here when only outlaws can have ciphertext...

Also with agrep's powerful extraction options it makes it easy
to abstract the "hits" into a useful form.  For example,

agrep -d "^From" 'PGP;(passphrase|Zimmerman|NSA)'

says output the entire mail record, delimited by 'From'
that contains 'PGP' and contains either 'passphrase',
'Zimmerman', or 'NSA'.

And agrep has been measured an -of-magnitude faster
than the second-best similarity tool publicly available.

As usual, I will be glad to e-mail the source and docs
to  who reqest them by e-mail IF they cannot do
an anonymous FTP.

Get this now.
It is too powerful to stay in the hands of the NSA.

I've seen PGP 2.2 mentioned for the Mac platform. I use 2.0 on MS/DOS.
Is  a 2.2 for MS/DOS? If so, a site or two that has it available
(I'd need executables, although source  be nice to review).
What was "fixed" or changed from 2.0 > 2.2?

I'd *desparately* per it if we didn't rehash the same arguments
that went on ad infinitum last time.  That's especially true for
sci.crypt.  For that matter, I've created alt.privacy., 
the traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now.

I'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan, hence my
followup to sci.crypt.  Frankly, if you're not an absolutist, your
feelings may turn on some of  issues.  For example -- with an
80-bit key, simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less
acceptable than other schemes, because it  that if just one
repository is, shall we say, overly pliable, a -be eavesdropper
 need to recover just 40 more bits of key.  I need not point out
in this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search.
A slightly more complex scheme -- XOR-ing the key with a random number,
and then with its complement --  produce two 80-bit subkeys,
neither of which is useful alone.  That variant is much more resistant
to attack.  Clearly, one can get even more sophisticated, to protect
the subkeys even more.

Other thoughts...  Some people have noted the size and complexity of
the databases necessary.  But the id strings the phones emit could be
 back door key, double-encrypted with the  repositories'
public keys.  For that matter, they could do that only with session
keys, and have no back door at all.  In that case, the FBI  have
to bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  This
 answer many of the objections along the  of ``how do you
make sure they stop''.

We can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back
door -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record
of the time, phone number, etc, of the call.  That provides proof to
the  agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of
the warrant.

I can suggest other variations, too.  Suppose each  chip had 100
public key pairs.  Each  be used ~10 times, after which you'd need
more keying material.  (Not a bad idea in any event.)  This could be
used to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant;
the keys the repository agents  deliver n't last for very
long.

I suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  Apart from
the obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the
back door? -- I  that the government is  genuinely concerned
about foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets.  This
scheme lets the spooks have  cake and eat it, too.  (I've heard
rumors, over the years, that some factions within NSA were unhappy with
DES because it was too good.  Not that they couldn't crack it, but it
was much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)  They're keeping
the details secret so that others  build  own implementations
without the back door.

The cryptographic protocol, though, is another matter.  I see no valid
reasons for keeping it secret, and -- as I hope I've shown above -- 
are a lot of ways to do things that aren't (quite) as bad.

This announcement is somewhat disconcerting; it doesn't do anything
evil in and of itself, but bodes badly for the future of open
algorithms and standards in information security.  I won't start
panicking until/unless DES or RSA or stuff like that is prohibited, but
I'm a little anxious.  (No doubt it won't be long before someone posts
explaining how this just a small part of some far-ranging and
long-lived NSA-PKP-IRS-FBI-CIA-HandgunControlInc-Clinton conspiracy to
subvert freedom, democracy, and mathematics.)  My feeling is that the
administration probably isn't that worried about things like DES and
RSA and PGP and ,  they'll never be used by a group much
wider than us computer geeks.

The fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things:

1.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, and it only just
    now happened to be ``ready'' to release to the world at this time.

2.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, but wasn't able
    to get the Bush administration to go along with this plan.  (I
    find it unlikely that this  have been because of a sympathy
    for the uned use of cryptography; more likely the
    administration felt that even ed, secret-algorithm and, for
    all we know, trivially breakable cryptography  not be made
    widely available.)

Thus said @csrc.ncsl.nist.gov ( Chip Announcement):
>This new technology will help companies protect proprietary
>information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
>and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
>electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the
>ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to

The majority of the discussion involving this " Chip" seems to
pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations.  Does anyone
know if that  this chip is designed to work primarily with analog
signals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.

The main thing I just  get is whether this chip implements
symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques.  Anybody know?

I'm guessing symmetric, but they  get very clear about it.  If it
is symmetric, how is it useful for anything other than link-level
encryption with an identical chip at each end?  How can you negotiate
a per-session key using symmetric cryptography without using a trusted
third party who knows your key?  (Or does it even use a per-session
key?)

If it's asymmetric, what about PKP's patents, which they claim cover
all methods of doing asymmetric cryptography?  Are they getting
royalties, or is hiding infringement the real reason for keeping the
algorithm secret? :-)

I change login passwords every couple of months.  I sure  suck if I had
to get a new sparc station everytime I wanted to do this.  It seems that this
is what they expect you to do if you want to routinely change your password
on your phone.  I'm sure the government contractor doesn't mind, but a system
where you can cheaply change keys (DES) has inherent security advantages, 
regardless of the algorithms involved.

From the limited details released so far, It seems that the  chip 
system must employ some sort of public key cryptography. Otherwise, the key 
management problems inherent to symetric ciphers  make the system 
unworkable. It probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes place
at the start of each call. Thats how they  identify the private key in 
 data base?

This  that either the NSA has developed some non RSA public key 
algorythm or the feds have decided to subsidize PKP & RSADSI. The former is 
rather an exciting posibility  keeping the algorythm secret  making
chip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard. If the feds
are forced to make it avalible in  to gain public acceptance than that 
could break RSA's stranglehold on public key crypto in the U.S.   

As for my impressions of the whole scheme It seems that instead of trying to
ban strong crypto, they are trying to co-opt it.  contention that they 
need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key
registration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm. More likely
is that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont 
have the keys registered. Anyone else notice that in  Q&A session, they
talk about releasing the keys only to people with proper autiorization but
caully dance around stating that the keys will simply have to be supeonaed.
They seem to be trying to keep open the posibility of obtaining keys without 
  even though tapping a phone line requires one. Also pick up on 
 implicit threat of eithe accept this or we'll ban strong crypto outright?
I dont trust this plan at all and plan to oppose it in all (legal) ways
possible.

I agree.  This is the danger I see, not the system itself.  That is to say,

I disagree, if for no other reason than that  are already other 
standards in place.  Besides, even if they restrict encryption on the NREN, 
who cares?  Most of the Internet is commercial anyway.  The NREN is only for 
geovernment and  research (read the proposals--it's a "data 
superhighway" for Cray users, not anything having to do with the Internet).

I saw this  posted in a local newsgroup.  I haven't seen it,
or any followup traffic relating to it in  groups or other groups
which I subscribe to.  So, I am posting it here so others can read it,
check it out, and comment on it, and provide ideas for handling 
sorts of things.

I have no verification to the accuracy or lack of accuracy of this
, but if accurate, I find it extremely disturbing, especially in
light of various abuses of the SSN number regarding privacy, (I understand
it is now to be required in CA to renew a drivers license, or to register
a car) and other proposals regarding 'smart' national Identity Cards,
wiretap proposals, and such.  One simply wonders what other gems are in
the wings ready to be sprung on the people by our government.  Perhaps
suggestions and ideas for preventing this and other such proposals from
acquiring the force of law  be useful.  The cost simply outweighs
any possible benefits, IMO.

BTW, reading this makes me  of some ideas a Prof Denning has been
promoting, in an even more disturbing form.

That said, with no further comment, the  follows:

_________________________________________________________________

For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993


                STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY


The President today announced a new initiative that will bring
the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary
program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
communications  meeting the legitimate needs of law
enforcement.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.

For too long  has been little or no dialogue between our
private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the
tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of
protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate
the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and
law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against
industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.

Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to
protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now  used to
protect electronic mail and computer files.   encryption
technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the
unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used
by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.

A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the " Chip" has
been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a
new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,
relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to
an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications
using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in
commercial use today.

This new technology will help companies protect proprietary
information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the
ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to
intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. 

A "key-" system will be established to ensure that the
" Chip" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding
Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique


                                2


"keys," numbers that will be needed by authorized government
agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the
device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately
in two "key-" data bases that will be established by the
Attorney General.  Access to  keys will be limited to
government officials with legal authorization to conduct a
wiretap.

The " Chip" technology provides law enforcement with no
new authorities to access the content of the private
conversations of Americans.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the
Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new
devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the
government will be offered access to the confidential details of
the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
 findings.

The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of
encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the
privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield
criminals and terrorists.  We need the " Chip" and other
approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access
to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it
to hide  illegal activities.  In  to assess technology
trends and explore new approaches (like the key- system),
the President has directed government agencies to develop a
comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:

     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to
          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;

     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone
          calls and data, under proper  or other legal
          , when necessary to protect our citizens;

     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern
          technology to build the National Information
          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and
          the competitiveness of American industry in the global
          marketplace; and 

     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export
          high technology products.

The President has directed early and frequent consultations with
affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the
privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.



                                3

The Administration is committed to working with the private
sector to spur the development of a National Information
Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer
technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to
information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks
("information superhighways") will transmit video, images, HDTV
programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone
system transmits voice.

 encryption technology will play an increasingly important
role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act
quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding
its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that
protect all Americans' right to privacy  also protecting
them from  who break the law.

Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. 
The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new
encryption technology are also available.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE




Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government
     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?

A:   No.  " Chip" technology provides law enforcement with
     no new authorities to access the content of the private
     conversations of Americans.

Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
     encrypted using the device.  What  they have to do to
     decipher the message?

A:   They  have to obtain legal authorization, normally a
      , to do the wiretap in the first place.  They
      then present documentation of this authorization to
     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and
     obtain the keys for the device  used by the drug
     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are
     stored separately in  to ensure the security of the key
      system.

Q:   Who will run the key- data banks?

A:   The two key- data banks will be run by two independent
     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the
     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will
     oversee the key- data banks.

Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure
     how strong the security is?  

A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption
     systems readily available today.   the algorithm will
     remain classified to protect the security of the key 
     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of
     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
     potential users that  are no unrecognized
     vulnerabilities.

Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?

A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the
     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in
     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the
     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet
     officials.

Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?

A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on
     encryption issues, and expect  discussions to intensify
     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have
     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
     decisions related to this initiative.

Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?

A:   The government designed and developed the key access
     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the
     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product
     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip
     manufacturer that produces them.

Q:   Who provides the " Chip"?

A:   Mykotronx programs it at  facility in Torrance,
     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device
     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed
     to other vendors in the future.

Q:   How do I buy one of  encryption devices? 

A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating
     the " Chip" into  devices.
     
Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
     solution like the one proposed,  the Administration be
     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
     powerful encryption devices?

A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
     considered during the broad policy review.  The key 
     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product
     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive
     than others readily available today, but it is just one
     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to
     encryption technology, which the Administration is
     developing.

     The Administration is not saying, " encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,
     we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have
     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that "every
     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product."   is a
     false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is
     an "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,
     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the "
     Chip" and similar encryption techniques.

Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton
     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from
     that of the Bush Administration?  

A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption
     technology in telecommunications and computing and are
     committed to working with industry and public-interest
     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'
     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law
     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime
     and terrorism.

Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use
     the government hardware?

A:   Voice encryption devices are  to export control
     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is
     required to ensure appropriate use of  devices.  The
     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the
     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give
     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this
     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a
     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use 
     devices to secure  own communications abroad.  We plan
     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability
     of  products.

Umm...  I beg to differ with the phrase ``only conceivable meaning''.
The SDNS protocols, for example, make explicit provision for multiple
encryption systems, as does PEM.  (And I'd love to see how they'd
mandate this new system for PEM without disclosing it....)

Mind you, I'm not saying that multiple algorithms will actually be
used -- but the relevant technologies certainly provide for them, which
certainly casts doubt on your choice of words.

 Chip is a response to the fact that  is no business
or professional body in a position to establish a standard and
provide chipsets to implement it for analog or digial transmission
systems.

RSA might be in position to do it, if they had active cooperation of
a couple of manufacturers of cellular phones or desktop phones.

Large companies in the voice/data comm business are out, because they
all have contracts with the gov which  be used to pressure them.

If we, as professionals in crypto s, EFF, etc. were to
put our collective minds and interests toward establishing a
crypto standard for transmission, and getting our companies to
implement it, we might avoid government control.

Otherwise, I  it will happen to us by default.  Gov isn't probably
strong enough or foolish enough to prevent strong crypt.  They
are strong enough, and we may be foolish enough, to push through
the  Chip.

Is RSA independt of the gov enough to spearhead this?  I, for one,
 *gladly* pay royalties via purchasing secure phones.

If not this, we  provide an algorithm which can be implemented
in either SW or HW and publish it, then push to make it the defacto
standard in the way that PGP and  are becoming such.

We are opposing, charging the bunker.  We  be nimble and clever.
The gov is strong, not clever.

Hear hear! I completely agree that we need to work quickly to
establish alternatives to the government's Clinton . As Brad
Templeton and others have noted, once the  becomes ensconced in
enough phones  will be enormous pressure to make it the *legal*
standard, and it will become the "market* standard as well. ( is
a lot of confusion in the proposal about whether the use of  is
mandated, about whether non- alternatives will be allowed, etc.)

( are also unclear issues about how hard, or how illegal, it will
be to make "workalikes" which meet the standard but which generate
phony or untappable keys...I'm sure the next several weeks will see
 issues thrashed out in this and other groups.)

Mean, I'd be interested to hear RSA Data Security's reaction.
Often criticized in this group for  licensing policies (the usual
complaints about MailSafe costing too much, at $125 or so, and the
general issue of software patents...), we may find that *allying*
ourselves with RSA is the best thing we can do. What's a mere
licensing fee when our liberty may be at stake? (If everyone who
wanted true security paid, say, $100 for a lifetime use of all of
RSA's patents--which expire in the period 1998-2002, or so--then RSA
 make tons of money and be happy, I'm sure. A small price to pay.
For  to whom $100 sounds like too much, I'm sure the actual terms
could be different, spread out over several years, whatever. To me,
it's a small price to pay.)

Strong crypto  strong privacy. ing keys, sending copies of
keys to large databases, and splitting keys into two 40-bit pieces,
all done with secret and non-analyzable protocols and algorithms, is
*NOT* strong crypto!

Whatever some of us may  about the abstract principles of
patenting number theory applications, this minor issue pales in
comparison with the potential dangers of the  proposal (note
that I said "potential"...we'll presumably learn more in the coming
months).

The RSA algorithms are at least public, have been analyzed and
attacked for years, and source code is available (to better ensure no
deliberate weakenesses or trapdoors).

I know of a number of groups putting together voice encryption systems
using off-the-shelf hardware (like Soundblaster boards for the PC) and
CELP-type software. The new generations of PCs, using fast 486s and
Pentiums are fast enough to do real-time voice encryption. Combined
with Diffie-Hellman key exchange, this  provide an alternative
to the  system.

Of course, we   know if the Administration proposes to
outlaw competing systems. (It seems to me that  goal of tapping
terrorists, child pornographers, and Hilary bashers  be thwarted
if low-cost alternatives to  proliferated. Not to defend child
pornographers or terrorists, but limiting basic freedoms to catch a
few criminals is not the American way of doing things. End of soapbox
mode.)

I suggest we in  groups set aside any diff we may have had
with RSA (and  look at me....I have both MacPGP *and* a fully
legal copy of "MailSafe"!) and instead work with them as quickly as we can.

RSA?, Jim?, are you listening?

-Tim May

P.S. I reserve the right to retract  opinions if it  turn
out that RSA Data Security was involved in the  proposal.

One presumes the system could work as follows:

a) Blank clips are manufactured by Mykotronx and VLSI.  The number
produced is caully audited and they are shipped to the first
 house.

It programs the chips with its half the key, and prints out a paper slip
with the key half and non-secret chip serial number.   The reams of paper
are filed in locked boxes in the vault, a fuse is burnt in the chip so
that the key is now unreadable.

The chip then goes to the next  house, where the same thing is
done.  This continues through N  houses, perhaps, could be more than
2.

The last one provides the chip to the cellular phone maker.

And yes, this has to be a public key system or it  be almost
impossible to handle.  It might not be RSA, but that does not mean
that PKP doesn't get paid.  Until 1997, PKP has the patent on the
general concept of public key encryption, as well as the particular
implementation known as RSA.

"Better than the status quo" isn't good enough, I'd say. The same 
technology could be implemented WITHOUT a back door open to the state.

We all know about power and corruption. But we all know that abuse is

Surely, if we must use pop patent law examples to discuss RC2 and RC4,

I wish I could agree with you.  Ask yourself this.  Why  any private
sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at least
partially compromised? (Key s in this instance)  Why  any
private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly
evaluated?  (i.e. algorythm not publically released)
The answer seems obvious to me, they n't.   is other hardware out
 not compromised.  DES as an example (triple DES as a better one.)

My suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on  non 
systems.  If not we're in trouble.

Given that the Clinton administration is not entirely stupid (although we'd like
to  so) I cannot believe that they have failed to realize this.
They know  initiative will fail, much as crippled DES was never taken
seriously.  The only way  moves can work is by coercion.  You know
little about politics if you  realize that this is just a first step
in the next move, it makes NO sense otherwise.  The next move, banning
or SEVERLY crippling crypto not using the "" system is easily
justified "Why  anyone want other encryption unless they were trying
to subvert the government?  We've provided you with a very secure alternative
so use it or go to jail/be fined/whatever."
How can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing
law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the  system
the only crypto available in the U.S... ?  You simply can't, and the administration
knows it.  Anyone who wanted to keep the govt. out of  hair, be it for
drug dealing or whatever,  just buy  available non- systems.

 sell our crafty Clinton types short, they can't be THAT stupid.
Either banning non  crypto is the next answer or the administrations
collective I.Q. is about that of a potato.

Why do you  AT&T jumped on so fast?  They know it's going to be big,
and NOT because it's better.  Right on the face of it, noone will buy the
stuff that doesn't have to.  AT&T must know this too,  MAN, why the
hell  they jump the gun?

I  wonder.

To wit:  The letter I just sent to Clinton:

The White House
Office of the Press Secretary c/o:
Presidential Comment Line (fax)
(202) 456-2461
 
April 17, 1993
 
Sir and/or Madam:
 
 
I must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption and
cryptography.  I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life.
 
It is apparent to me that  who drafted the " Chip Proposal" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the "Big Brother Proposal") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep





ends on caul scrutiny by  sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from "experts" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.
 
In addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key  is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will per to purchase equipment not crippled by government key , no matter how "tamper proof" the key s might be.
 
I cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker  have failed to realize  flaws.  I can only assume then that the drafters of the " Chip Proposal" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector.  The only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion.  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti





lize the "Big Brother Chip."
 
Unfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing.  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like "harmony," "right to encryption," and "voluntary."
 
It mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is "I can't believe it's happening here."  More startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant; "When is the Reichstag fire planned for?"

What they  need to do, though, is make sure that nobody has
access to decent crypto in the first place.  They probably can't
tell ed voice from ed triple-DESed voice until they
get  copy of your key.  Any criminal who's going to use
encryption will do it under cover of .  The only way to avoid
this will be to try to prohibit strong encryption.

I probably n't say this, but they could try to detect the use
of an illegal cypher by transmitting in the clear some statistical
properties of the plaintext.  An old-fashioned wiretap could then
detect the use of pre-encryption, which  drastically increase
the measured entropy of the input.  A countermeasure to this 
be to use steganographic techniques which put out voice.

You can tell if the NSA built this feature in: blow on the mike, and
observe whether a band of thugs comes through your ceiling.

>The main thing I just  get is whether this chip implements
>symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques.  Anybody know?

I  know, but I'm as willing to speculate as anyone.

Several people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography.
Another possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some other
algorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on
a session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something
like DES) for the encryption.

How could the "back door" keys work in this system?  I can see a few
possibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that
the session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door
keys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers
used in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.

Another possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips
simply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip's own
internal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys
usable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip's
secret key doesn't need to be a public key in this usage, but can be
identical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most
straightforward to me.)

 another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the
message itself has a "dual key" property, that possession of either of
two keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key  be the session key from
the DH exchange, and the other  be the back door key for the chip.

It's worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised
during her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and
December was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party 
participate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn't quite fit into
what we know of how  works but it hints that  who had early
knowledge of  (or whose ing was somehow synchronized with
 designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on  minds.

I'd lay long odds that it was the other way around.  Clinton didn't
just pull this plan out of any bodily orifices; the NSA has to have
been working on it for years.   it's possible that Denning (and
other prominent people) just happened to start arguing for such a
system, it seems more likely that  was a suggestion involved.
If this guess is wrong, I apologize.

In light of my recent paranoia concerning government proposals, I'd love to
see a UNIX-based encryption scheme that:

1) Kept some files encrypted on the host machine (say, all the files in your
   home directory)
2) Used a key system that could not be compromised by eavesdropping over a
   modem line.

It seems that this  require modifications to a shell program and a
way of telling whether a file was encrypted or not, among other things.

I'd love to know about potential security holes in such a system.

Does such a system exist?  If it were made easy-to-use and readily
available, I  it  be a Good Thing(tm).  I realize that this
 probably just involve putting a nice front-end on a readily available
and very secure encryption scheme, but it  be done.

Thanks for the ear,
Brad

Hmm, my first thought was that they're using Diffie-Hellman exponential
session key exchange, or an equivalent.  However, the Diffie-Hellman
patent, like the Hellman-Merkle one on public key systems, claims
all equivalents, so the basic point stands.

Interestingly, a quote from Jim Bidzos showed up in the media real
soon after the announcement, and he sounded very pissed.  Maybe he hadn't
yet realized that PKP might have just struck gold?  All they have to
do is get someone to admit the general scheme that the  uses.

Not at all. Two weeks ago I registered a concern about some programming
that was  conducted by a student organisation here at the
 of Texas at San Antonio.  As a result, I was interrogated
by the capus police, who also attempted to create a positive-identification
file (photo, fingerprints, etc.). I used to permit this, and filed a
complaint with the  administration.  The Vice-President for
Business Affairs (the 'boss' of the campus police) stated that he had no
interest in the legal/Constitutional implications of  actions.

    No. The LAPD officers were tried first by the State of California
on charges of police brutality, and secondly by the Federal Government
on depriving RK of his civil rights - a different crime.

    The scenario I outline is more similar to the Oliver North trial.
Ollie confessed to treason (aiding an enemy of the US) during Senate
hearings, under immunity. The team which was later to prosecute him on
criminal charges had to sequester itself from all reports of ON's
immunized testimony. ON's lawyer brought up the probability that at
least someone on the team had heard about the Senate testimony, and it
was a strong factor against the prosecution, which is one of the
reasons this ON is  walking around free today.

If the data isn't  when the warrant comes, you effectively have
secure crypto.  If secret backups are kept...then you effectively have
no crypto.  Thus, this poster is essentialy arguing no crypto is better
than secure crypto.

If the data isn't  when the warrant comes, then the government will
just have to use normal law enforcement techniques to catch crooks.  Is
this so bad?   BTW, bugging isn't YET a normal law enforcement technique.
With the privacy , it WILL become a normal technique.

This way to detect pre-encryption may be defeated ; one can do  
transformation of the spectrum of encrypted signal just by adding some 
pre-arranged (in the beginning of communication) function.
I  so. Say, you can do FFT of your encrypted signal.

What follows is my opinion. It is not asserted to be "the truth" so no
flames, please.  It comes out of a background of 20 years as a senior
corporate staff executive in two Fortune 50 companies.

I'd be happy to use a crypto system supplied by the NSA for business, if
they told me it was more secure than DES, and in particular resistant to
attempts by Japanese, French, and other competitive companies and
governments to break.

I'd be happy to do so even with ed keys, provided I was happy about
the bona fides of the  agencies (the Federal Reserve  certainly
satisfy me, as  something set up by one of the big 8 accounting firms).

I'd trust the NSA or the President if they stated  were no trap
doors--I'd be even happier if a committee of independent experts examined
the thing under seal of secrecy and reported back that it was secure.

I'd trust something from the NSA long before I'd trust something from some
Swiss or anybody Japanese.

This may seem surprising to some here, but I suggest most corporations 
feel the same way. Most/many/some (pick one) corporations have an attitude
that the NSA is part of our government and "we support our government", as
one very famous CEO put it to me one day.

Just some perspective from another point of view.

Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?

A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on
     encryption issues, and expect  discussions to intensify
     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have
     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
     decisions related to this initiative.

Congress??  So we're playing politics before we talk to CPSR, academia,
the public, internet users?  I`ve heard of top-down design, but top-down 
democracy?? [Just whose state/district are the chip manufacturers in?]

Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
     solution like the one proposed,  the Administration be
     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
     powerful encryption devices?

A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
     considered during the broad policy review. [...bs about
     the wonderfulness of the key  system...]

     The Administration is not saying, " encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,
     we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have
     effectively done); 

They'll just provide an easily-compromised version to JQ Public.

                         nor is the U.S. saying that "every
     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product."  

Maybe we need a CRA -- Cryptographic Rights Amendment.

                                                   is a
     false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is
     an "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,
     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the "
     Chip" and similar encryption techniques.

Nice lullaby.  But why am I not soothed?

Why repeat themselves?  It appears to some (and the story looks pretty
convincing to me, too) that the Justice Department stole a case-tracking
system, modified it, and distributed it to "friendly" police and suchlike
agencies around the world, eg. the Canadian Mounties.  Of course, I have 
no doubt they swore Scout's Honor that  were no backdoors.

With that kind of intelligence, who'd want to be swamped with terabytes
of commercial traffic?

If the Administration is this far along, is it possible that the
government been working on it for a  and has been using the
Dennings to prime the pump, so to speak, or as the Judas goat?
Whether paid off, just gullible, or what, doesn't  matter.

It might also be possible that the NSA / whoever has had the idea for
this for quite a , has been promoting it (Denning, et al) and
siezed the new opportunity - a new administration who wants to spend
more money on espionage than Bush did.

Whatever, i'm not so sure that the cause/effect  is totally
obvious.

   I have lurked here a bit lately, and though some of the math is
unknown to me, found it interesting. I thought I  post an  I
found in the Saturday, April 17, 1993 Toronto Star:

                  ' CHIP' to protect privacy

   Washington (REUTER) - President Bill CLinton announced yesterday a
plan to plant a new " Chip" in every government telephone and
computer line to prevent eavesdropping.

   Eventually the chips, developed by the government's National
Institute for Standards and Technology,  be used by commercial and
private electronics communication users.

   The White House said that to assure privacy, each device containing
the encryption devices  be assigned two unique "keys" - numbers
that will be needed by government agencies to decode messages.

   The attorney-general has been assigned the task of arranging that the
keys are deposited in two "key-" data bases. Access to them 
be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a
wiretap, the White House said in a statement.

It seems to me that all discussions about  security are almost 
irrelevant - if I cannot choose the key, but have to use a key chosen for
me by the foundry, the security of the WHOLE UNIVERSE OF USERS is as good
(or as bad) as the security of VLSI Technologies Inc.

It is a trivial effort to run any ciphertext agains ALL THE KEYS EVER 
MANUFACTURED - after all we are talking about 1 to 100 million keys that
will ever be manufactured. The key depositories can be as secure and
incorruptible as they wish to be, nobody cares anyway...:-(

Now if someone  convince me that the shipping docks of VTI, ATT and
others are impenetrable (remember: the chips have to ship with the key - 
you or the dealer are going to submit it to the authorities eventually)
I'd be a bit happier. But do we  believe that the various governments
(including ours) won't have the full lists of all the keys ever manufactured?

Did I miss something here?

My own opinions, quite obviously...

Ed, as usual, makes a very good point.

One time a friend of mine at Sun sent me an e-mail.  He composed it using the
Sun OpenWindows 3 "mailtool" which handles (non-MIME) "attachments" and the
like.

 I  use "mailtool", I had to manually save it, cut & paste, and
then "uudecode" the actual attachment.  What I got - after a not-inconsiderable
amount of time spent doing this - was an audio file.  The original message
was over 32Kb of mail headers and uuencoded data; the resulting audio message
was a single sentence that I transcribed as a 135 character message.

If he had sent me the sentence in plain text, the e-mail  have been
around 250 bytes, and it  have taken me about 3 seconds to process it at
most.  Instead, it was 32k and it took at least a minute.  A complete waste of
(my) time and bandwidth, as far as I'm concerned.  Sending plain text is 
the most efficient method of transmission, given the same transport mechanism.
I shudder to  what  happen if everyone started posting  Usenet
 as audio files instead of plain text!  Meltdown of the Net predicted!
Film at Eleven!

Hi !

I am interested in the source of FEAL encryption algorithm.
Does someone of you know where I can get the source from, or
where I can find documentation about FEAL.

Thanks in advance

The  chip is just the culmination of Dorthy Denning et all.
But lets ignore that for the moment.

The fundamental question is:Can the government stop me from using
encryption?

Ignoring for the moment the question of patented processes (such as
Public Keys), can the government stop me from using an encryption
process?

If the answer is yes then what freedom we have in this country is
truly gone and its time to get out the guns or the lawyers
(depending upon which causes more damage and to whom).

However assuming that I can  encrypt things as I please, who
cares about the  chip? As far as I'm concerned a phone line
is insecure PERIOD. I  care if they encrypt it 10 ways from
sunday, if I didn't do the encrypting, I  trust it. This is the
attitude that everyone else  have. Instead of worrying about a
 chip, simply connect your handset to your computer and feed
the voice single through, process, encrypt, and transmit over the
phone. The guy on the other hand then does the same in reverse.

Can't work you say? No Standard you say? Obviously you have never
uses PGP.

Anyone who expects the government to protect  freedoms is
kidding themselves. Only you can protect your own freedoms.

One final thought addressed to EFF:
	1.Do you support the implementation of ANY form of
	encryption where the encryption key must be revealed?
	2.If you do, why? If not, why?
	3.What SPECIFIC actions are you planning to take to either
	support or stop this proposal?
	4.If you do not support this proposal, what alternatives do
	you offer?

It might pay to start looking at what this proposal might mean to a
police agency.  It just might be a bad idea for them, too.

OK, suppose the NY State Police want to tap a suspect's phone.  They
need a warrant, just like the old days.  But unlike the old days, they
now need to 

   (a) get two federal agencies to give them the two parts of
       the key.

Now, what happens if 's a tiff between the two  houses?
Posession/release of keys becomes a political bargaining chit.  State
and lower-level police agencies have to watch the big boys play politics,
 potentially good leads disappear, lives and property are lost,
statutes of limitations run out, etc.  Not to mention: a moderately
clever person who suspects the police are after her/him will be buying
new phones faster than tap requests can be processed.  Or using stolen
ones.  [Will the Turing Police come and arrest you for transmitting
without a dialing license?]

's also bureacracy and security problems -- within each  house, 
how will requests for key disclosure be authenticated?  Put in enough
safeguards of the kind bureaucrats and activists feel comfortable with, and 
it might take a LONG time to get that key.  [Even when a request is approved, 
how is the key going to be disclosed?  Will it be encrypted by a -type
chip for transmission?  In a bureaucracy the size of the Federal
Government, with a databank of the necessary size, and data traffic of
the projected volume, 's going to be a lot of weak links.  How many of 
 kinds of problems will be open for public or "expert" scrutiny?]  

Furthermore, the Feds might be leery of handing completed keys around, 
even to State Police agencies: a trust and security issue.  This  be 
an especially acute issue if some other State's Police had mishandled a 
key, resulting in lawsuits, financial settlements, and political 
embarassment.  So, the Feds implement it this way:
 
   (b) some federal agency gets the keys, performs the tap, and
       turns the results over to the NY State Police.

But let's say Cuomo's been causing some problems over a Clinton
Aid-To-Urban-Areas proposal.  Or  just happens to be a turf war
going on between the State cops and the Justice department on a case.
Now, not only do we have the keys as a political chit, we have an
extra player in the game *and* we have the tap's tapes as another
bargaining chit.  Again, the State Police lose.

I understand that (legal) wiretaps are quite expensive to maintain. In
scenario (b), who pays the bill?

Following precedent in other areas, the government is likely to put a tax on
encryption technology.  Once the tax is imposed, it becomes a federal matter
and suspicision of an unlicensed cryptographic tool will bring the BATF or
FBI tossing grenades into your house.  (The BATF appears to be the logical
agency to enforce such regulations: federal control over alocohol, tobacco,
and firearms is similary based on taxes.)

Look at the FCC: they won't allow sale of any receiever that can receive
bands that are supposed to be private.  This has nothing to do with any
desire to prevent harmful interference. If the government can make a radio
receiver illegal what makes you  they won't claim the right to control
encryption?

Simply  up a question to ask her about her involvement, but be

In this country, MI5 are *experts* at answering  questions; for
instance  was a British journalist (Jonathon Moyle) killed in South
America a couple of years ago.  Parliament asked "Was he an MI5 employee"
"No." - turns out afterwards he wasn't paid, theore wasn't an employee.
They could equally have said he wasn't an agent - he went abroad on his
private business with no brief from MI5, but was interviewed and debriefed
at length only *on his return*.

  The dead giveaway is the repeated protestations that the new plan is aimed
at "criminals", "drug dealers", "terrorists", etc.  You'd  the tactic
 be too obvious to trot out yet again after a decade of Sarah and the
rest of the Brady Bunch using it to destroy the Second Amendment, but evidently
the control nuts feel it will serve them one more time.

  As far as the export needs of American companies are concerned, I could
almost believe that the plan to saddle the US industry with a hidden sabotaged
algorithm was invented by a cabal of Japanese lobbyists.

I am not an expert in the cryptography science, but some basic things
seem evident to me, things which this Clinton  do not address.
The all pertain to opportunites for abuse, and conclusions based on what
I have seen the membership of this group (except for two notable persons)
agree to.  If anything bad is possible by the government in theory, it
almost always ends up happening in fact.  So the key is to make abuse
IMPOSSIBLE.  Question authority, and remember power DOES corrupt.

I  one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it WILL be
expanded to include other data forms, such as data transfer and stored
data. and as such  be treated as if it were expanded (or such
expansion will be almost impossible to stop, using  as a precident).
 was a hint of that in the proposal, remember.  That said, please
bear with me, I am not very articulate, so I take more words to say
what others could say much more briefly.  Thank you.

>today.

As I suggested this is NOW.  The hint is in the proposal that this or
similar proposals are  considered for other forms of encryptions
such as data transfer, data files, and such, largely dependent on how
this thing is accepted or flies.  I  one  be wise to treat
this in the manner one  when (not if) it gets expanded to other
areas than cellular phones.  I  this is guaranteed to happen, if
this proposal gets by.  Salami politics.  It has been and is used in
several other areas, it is certain to be used here.  Government is not
going to easily give up on the idea that they  be able to eavesedrop
whenever they want to.  '  required' has proven to be a rather
flimsy guarantee.  If the case warrants, they can always sieze the
material, and force one to give the key, or sit in jail forever on
periodically renewed contempt charges.  So it is not denying the justice
system the information, nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty
(or uses to divulge the  to access the info - this is not
protected under the Fifth - one can be forced to perform ACTS that 
result in divulging incriminating evidence).  So, blocking restrictions
on private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement - it
does make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult.  Especially
fishing expeditions without the target's knowlege.   give up the
right to be safe from that - that  be non-negotiable, and Clinton
and Co. know it (which is probably why they quietly developed this thing,
figuring if they get it this far, they can ram it on through).  How come
 consulted could be roughly described as "us insiders"?  They cannot
quietely IMPLIMENT it though, when they ban other schemes to ensure its
exclusive use.  Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone.
 buy into it.  Has government  earned that kind of trust,
past or future?  To be secure and free, one must keep government honest
and the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE, not 'unlikely'
or 'difficult'.

So what?  One could use information gained by re-use of the keys (saved
after the last case was finished) or other  (master key, backdoor,
easily broken algorithm) to find other evidence which, given to a judge,
 authorize a tap which n't have been possible otherwise.  This
has been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past...  For
local cops, this might be workable to keep them honest, but the Feds
have a workaround somehow, BET on it.  Does anyone  believe
for example, that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listen
in on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime or
via a 'master key'?  I sure .

This whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use
old-fashioned police work to build a case.  In the past, eavesdropping
was rather easy (with or without a  ).  I  the Law
Enforcement community has become a bit spoiled, and will resist changes
that require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work.  I
just find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much
about civil and individual rights, that "puts people first".  The question
is "put people first" to WHERE?

With the innards not  revealed, how is one to be sure  DOESN'T
exist a 'master key' for use by NSA, etc (so they can do  keyword
scan, etc on conversations they routinely monitor, without a specific
 )?   Remember, the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY.
Bet on it.  And so far I have not heard about police telling people that
they have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found.  What is to
keep them from simply keeping the keys on file for 'next time'? After
a, they  have quite a collection.  Kept especially for folks
they deem 'disruptive'.  And if they get only one key, that 
reduce the search space a lot, unless it is an RSA scheme.  Remember
Nixon years?  Need for  s  slowed them down, didn't it?

And unless the  accounts are not government controlled (fat chance!
I see one ending up  under, say Treasury, the other under Justice
:-)) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to
a competitor's Clinton  (or descendent when this idea is expanded
to be used for all non-government encryption).  Enough bucks  get
one the keys or the innards for this algorithm.  Perhaps not an important
concern, but given past government behavior and the other problems...

What will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption?  You
can BET that if  is accepted, that will be next on the agenda.
It is even hinted at in the proposal - read it caully...  Expect the
argumet "well, if you got nothing to hide..."  Fine. Then using that
argument, one  not object to video cameras  installed in
every room of one's home.  Granted - an exteme expansion of the idea but
the principle holds.  Private stuff  remain private, even from a
govt fishing expedition.  And laws/rules may change in the future as
to 'safeguards'.  When it comes to the Fed Government, safeguards are
pretty meaningless, if they want to do/get something.

 work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights, or establish
bad precidents, please.  The price could be hell to pay, later.

People  fight laws forbidding more NOW, but in, say two years,
because we have this 'crisis' situation which MUST be addressed by some
'drastic action', just this added reasonable restriction will only bother
 who have someting to hide... etc.  Please  buy into it.

If the Clinton  is so very good, why not make its algrithm public
so many people can exchange ideas and examine it, rather than a few
isolated 'respected experts' (respected by whom?  for what?  Perhaps a
certain professor who likes key banks  be one of the selected
experts... this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was
advocating, if I recall :-).  How  anybody know that what the
experts examine is the same as what will end up  used in the 
Chip, if it is kept secret?   Perhaps the  will use a crippled
version (with a 'master key' provision), or features not present in the
version ed for study and evaluation by the experts.  And who
chooses the expertes?  The government?  No conflict of interest ...
:-)

And isn't it a REQUIREMENT for any decent encryption scheme that it NOT
have its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known?
I was lead to believe that one  assume the other side has everything
you have, except for the key(s)... I recall ideas presented to this
group are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret...

Another question -  it is a safe bet this  thing  not
be used for government security, they are regarding it as not real secure
but "good enough" for common folk.  I  I  like to see a full
description (not a PR non-statement) of just what "good enough" ?
I  when saying how strong it is, "good enough"   "not
very".  The excuse that other countries have  restrictions is not
acceptable:  Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and
Constitution (which the people, not the governments, of  other
countries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have as
revokable privileges).  And if we expect to retain  rights and
protections, we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTA
have this thing to 'fight crime'.  We have allready have our Bill of
Rights pretty much torn to shreds.  We  not permit more weakining
for yet another 'noble cause', instead we  be trying to repair
the damage.  Our crime problem may have a number of causes, but "too
many rights and safeguards" is not a signifigant one.  A broken 
system and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having
"too many rights" (disregarding addressing the root causes for crime,
etc).

BTW -  who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton, believe
this:  I  be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed
this thing.  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights
under the Constitution or Bill of Rights.  The last couple of decades
have been a non-stop series of end-runs around the protections of the
Constitution.  It has to stop.  Now is as good a time as any, if it

And if Richard Nixon had had this kind of toy, he n't have had
to send people into the Watergate.

But that's not  the issue.  The real issue is whether this 
will be used to justify a ban against individuals' use of private 
(i.e., anything else) encryption methods.

Unrelated question...isn't the term "," as neat as it is,
already taken by Intergraph?

A few more sources are statistics on your filesystems (easily

You can also exec a finger to one or more favorite heavily-used

I'm completely against anything that makes it easier for the

of the government and specifying exactly what the governments
rights were (and this didn't include a gov't spy in every
bedroom).  IMHO,  are entirely too many things going on
today designed to preserve the government organism at the expense
of individuals.  Look around and reread 1984 and many early
Heinlein books.  Aren't  many parallels between the thought
police (can you spell Waco Texas?), and Heinlein's ``Crazy Years''?

I received the following two notes from Martin Hellman with details
on how  will work.  They are posted with his permission.  The
implications of some details are fascinating.

Date: Sat, 17 Apr 93 23:05:23 PDT
From: "Martin Hellman" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu>
To: (a long list of recipients)
:  Chip


Most of you have seen the announcement in Friday's NY Times,
etc. about NIST (National Institute of Standards & Technology)
announcing the " Chip" crypto device. Several messges
on the net have asked for more technical details, and some have
been laboring under understandable misunderstandings given
the lack of details in the news  . So here to help out
is your friendly NSA link: me. I was somewhat surprised Friday
to get a call from the Agency which supplied many of the missing
details. I was told the info was public, so here it is (the cc of this
to Dennis Branstad at NIST is mostly as a double check on my
facts  I assume he is aware of all this; please let me know
if I have anything wrong):

The  Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in 
Silicon. Each chip will have two secret, 80-bit keys. One will be the 
same for all chips (ie a system-wide key) and the other will be unit 
specific. I  know what NIST and NSA will call them, but I will 
call them the system key SK and unit key UK in this message. 
The IC will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so 
that the system key can be kept secret. (Aside: It is clear that 
they also want to keep the algorithm secret and, in my opinion, 
it may be as much for that as this stated purpose.) The unit key 
will be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 
and K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two  
authorities. Who   authorities will be is  to be 
decided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that 
they will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they 
must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased. 
When a law enforcement agency gets a  , they will 
present it to  two  authorities and receive K1 and 
K2, by allowing access to the unit key UK.

In addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his 
or her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key 
plain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be 
encrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK, 
and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part 
message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK 
producing

     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}

When a   obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law 
enforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information 
flowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that 
they may do this constantly on all links, with or without a 
 ,  it is almost impossible to tell which links 
over which a message will flow.] This gives the agency access to 

     E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number

in the above message. They then check the serial number 
of the unit and see if it is on the "watch list" for which they 
have a  . If so, they will decrypt E[K; UK] to obtain K, 
and then decrypt E[M; K] to obtain M.

I am  in the process of assessing this scheme, so please do 
not take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed 
scheme. All I am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme 
more knowledgably. But I will say that the need for just one  
 worries me. I  feel more comfortable (though not 
necessarily comfortable!) if two separate  s were 
needed, one per  authority.  no explanation is
needed, the following story adds some color: In researching
some ideas that Silvio Micali and I have been kicking around,
I spoke with Gerald Gunther, the constitutional law expert
here at Stanford and he related the following story: When
Edward Levi became Pres. Ford's attorney general (right
after Watergate), he was visited by an FBI agent asking
for "the wiretap authorizations." When Levy asked for
the details so he could review the cases as required by
law, the agent told him that his predecessors just turned
over 40-50 blank, signed forms every time. Levi did not
comply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear: 
No single person or authority  have the power to
authorize wiretaps (or worse yet, divulging of personal
keys). Sometimes he or she will be an Edward Levi
and sometimes a John Mitchell.

: Re:  Chip

It is fine to post my previous message to sci.crypt 
if you also post this message with it in which:

1. I ask recipients to be sparse in  requesting further info 
from me or asking for comments on specific questions. By
this posting I apologize for any messages I am unable to
respond to. (I already spend too much time answering too much
e-mail and am particularly overloaded this week with other
responsibilities.) 

2. I note a probably correction sent to me by Dorothy Denning.
She met with the person from NSA that
I talked with by phone, so her understanding is likely to
better than mine on this point: Where I said the transmitted
info is  E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}
she says the message is not double encrypted. The system
key (or family key as she was told it is called) only encrypts
the serial number or the serial number and the encrypted
unit key. This is not a major difference, but I thought it
 be mentioned and thank her for bringing it to
my attention. It makes more sense  it cuts down
on encryption computation overhead.

   Hey, it's better than the status quo.

   I am far less worried about "the feds" tapping my phone than high school 
   scanner surfers who get  kicks out of eavesdropping on cellular and 
   cordless phone calls.

I'm a political dissident. I'm scared shitless of the feds listening
in on my calls. My opinions are the sort that  get me
"disappeared" in a slightly less free society -- and who knows what
sort of society we will be in in five or ten years? I have friends who
have had  phones tapped -- none of this is theoretical to me.

As for "its better than the status quo", well, first of all, you can
get a cryptophone from companies like Cylink today -- and they work
well. In addition, a number of groups are now working on building
software to turn any PC into a privacy enhanced phone right now -- and
they are all working in overdrive mode.

   And yes, I'd rather just see all crypto restrictions lifted, but this is at 
   least an incrememental improvement for certain applications...

 ARE no crypto restrictions... yet. You can use anything you want
RIGHT NOW. The point is to maintain that right.

   Excuse me?  This has *already* happened.  's a couple of humps in
   the tent already.  Ask the folks at Qualcomm what became of the
   non-trivial encryption scheme they proposed for use in  CDMA
   digitial cellular phone standard?   *already* are restrictions in
   place.

You have it slightly wrong. They dumped the encryption system because
they could not export it -- not because they could not produce it for
U.S. use.  are no legal restraints on citizen use of strong
cryptography -- yet.

As John Gilmore has pointed out repeatedly, if you produce the
infrastructure that  permit a police state to function, all that
is required to suddenly find yourself living in one is a change of
attitude on the part of the government.

Our constitution was built by men who had to risk  lives to
ensure freedom in our country. They designed the system to make it
difficult for tyranny to arise. For instance, one of the reasons the
fourth amendment was put  was to make it harder for the
government to try to make smuggling a crime.  I jest? John
Hancock made all his money smuggling rum, which is, after all, a drug.

 about it. The government has everyones keys in , and the
FBI gets  pet "wiretap without leaving the office" scheme. 
is a coup, which happens every day all around the world. Within hours,
everyone in the country who might oppose the tyrants is 
monitored more closely than ever before possible.

Without the tools  in place, a tyranny cannot stand. With tools
like this in place, a tyrannical dictatorship could actually be
successfully imposed.

Why give the government tools with which to enslave you? Maybe you can
trust Bill Clinton, but are you willing to tell me that you can trust
EVERY government that will ever arise in the U.S. hereafter? I am not
willing to make that leap of faith.

I'm a political dissident. As such, I am acutely aware of what happens
to political dissidents in most of the world. In most of the world, I
could be killed for my beliefs. Call Amnesty International some time
to find out what happens to dissidents in most of the world.

All that seperates the U.S. from most of  places is a thin piece
of parchment in the National Archives thats  constantly more and
more eroded by such farces as the war on drugs. Coups have happened in
countries that have had stable democracies for over a hundred years.
Governments throughout history have fallen. No government has lasted
for more than a few hundred years. Often, they are replaced by
dictatorships. Do you  believe so intensely that it could never
ever ever happen here that you are willing to bet your own life and
the lives of your children and other loved ones on it?

If we construct the tools with which tyranny could be enforced, we
make it s of magnitude more likely that it could happen, because
if it happened with the tools already in place it could actually
stick. 

Naive fools such as our leadership believe they can protect us where
hundreds that have gone before have failed. Thriving democracies led
by men far more skillfull than Bill Clinton have fallen to
dictatorship. Rome had a thriving republic run by exquisitely skilled
men before they became a tyranny.

I, for one, am unwilling to trust that it could never happen here.
Only hubris  allow us to believe we are immune to what has
happened elsewhere.

   My point? I suspect this list, interesting as it is for various

   Some of them, yes. Others, no. 

I received mail from Mitch Kapor saying that he did not ask to be on

Short summary of what Bellovin says Hellman says the NSA says:  is
a global key G, plus one key U_C for each chip C. The user can choose a
new session key K_P for each phone call P he makes. Chip C knows three
keys: G, its own U_C, and the user's K_P. The government as a whole
knows G and every U_C. Apparently a message M is encrypted as
E_G(E_{U_C}(K_P),C) , E_{K_P}(M). That's it.

The system as described here can't possibly work. What happens when
someone plugs the above ciphertext into a receiving chip? To get M
the receiving chip needs K_P; to get K_P the receiving chip needs U_C.
The only information it can work with is C. If U_C can be computed
from C then the system is cryptographically useless and the ``key
'' is bullshit. Otherwise how is a message decrypted?

	This appears to be generic calling upon the name of the anti-christ.
Just for the hell of it, let's destroy this remark. Let us imagine that
the executive branch actually could extract keys from the  houses
without anyone knowing, or telling. Now what? Dick has 80 bits of data.
What the hell's he gonna do with it?

	1) Trot around to the telco and say 'we'd like an unauthorised
decrypting tap'. Uh huh.
	2) Break in to watergate and install his own tap (so his people 
do have to break in, neat, huh?) record some noise, then get the Executive
Branch Phone Decryption Box (huh? they've got one? Goodness, wait 'til the
washington post gets hold of this) and decrypt the noise.
	3) More likely, stare at the key, and say 'Oh, hell it's not
worth all this bloody hassle'

	Truth is, even granted *lots* of covert power on the part of
the Executive Branch, this system is *more* difficult to tap with than
POTS gear. The fact that it is easier to tap than some hypothetical
system neither you nor I am going to place on our phones is neither
here nor .

	The only rational concerns I am seeing raised are:

	a) is the key  just chopped in half, and not some XOR
arrangement? That is, has some egregious technical error been built
in to the plan?
	b) is this is the first step toward strict regulation of strong
encryption?


>But that's not  the issue.  The real issue is whether this 
>will be used to justify a ban against individuals' use of private 
>(i.e., anything else) encryption methods.

	This is b), of course. I suspect not. If the government actually
wanted to make such regs, they'd just do it. A few hundred people on Usenet
yelling about it n't even slow the machine down.

	Besides, who is this mysterious 'they' who's going to take away
all our rights the instant we let our guard down? Congress? That gang
of buffoons can't even balance  checkbooks. The FBI? But.. they
 make the laws. The NSA? Ditto. The white house? Bill Clinton
is probably  looking for the bathroom. It's a big place, after all.

As am I

If "high quality secure NSA classified technology"  handing my key
over to whomever, I'll take PGP any day.

Right now they are billing it as voluntary, i.e. bend over, here it comes.

As soon as enough Wiretap chip based units are out , how much
easier do you  it will be to redefine "on your own" to mean
write it yourself and  even  about distributing it...?

Get honest, no one is going to buy this trash if they KNOW it's compromised
already, and less will buy it if the algorithm is not disclosed.

The NSA knows that making this stuff available to the public 
handing it to whatever foreign powers are interested in the process.
 when has export control stopped anyone (especially software wise)

Ask yourself caully if " high quality secure NSA classified technology "
is something they are going to hand out.  Not unless you can drive a
NSA van through the holes.

We might get further if we begin by accepting that the government 
 couldn't be bod less about the political opinions of the 
right wing pro establishment types. Just about the only circumstances 
in which I could  that they  be interested in  political 
views  be to recruit them as spooks. They can be guaranteed to give
the government line when it counts. In US history it has been the 
socialists such as myself who have been persecuted. 


Now before people start asserting that  is no mechanism by which
the administration can get  new chip adopted without legal force
lets try ing.

In the first place the  chip must have existed for several years as
a defense project. Theore this is not a party matter at all. George Bush
was in any case hardly adverse to tapping calls, he was chief spook 
remember.

Secondly the govt can quite easily apply pressure. They simply "ask" 
chums who they give huge defense contracts to (motorola etc) to be "nice"
boys. After all Bill is giving them a nice little trade monopoly  the
chips won't be avaliable to foreign firms.

Thirdly the people who consider the Democrats to be socialist are not the
same as the ones who consider socialists to be communist. People might know
this if the US education system did not suffer from the Mcarthyite and 
Dewy version of political correctness - the sort with tribunals and show 
trials. Ever seen Ed Meese pissed? I have, it was when he said that socialism
and communism were the same thing and brought the house down with laughter.
It took several minutes before we realised that he was serious.

      are some issues which come to mind when one considers
the law enforcement aspects of the use of the Big Brother
() chip.
     The drug dealers and terrorists aren't going to let
themselves be caught by using this type of encryption.  In 1985
the New York Times reported that government investigators broke
up a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticated
equipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring to
eavesdrop on the law-enforcement agents who were trying to arrest
them.
     A Mr. Deely, an NSA official, said " are a lot of
medium-sized countries that  have been proud to have the
signals intelligence operation of this group."
     For every John Gotti  are probably many more people who
have the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecure
communications are.  The press given to the Big Brother chip will
only increase  numbers.
     Even if  is some benefit to law-enforcement through the
use of Big Brother, it must be weighed against the constitutional
and civil liberties questions involved.
     For example, in some areas of the world torture is used as
an investigative tool by the local "law-enforcement" people.  I
suspect it is an effective  of obtaining information and
shortening many investigations.  It probably also helps keep the
conviction rate high.
     The fact that the torture tool is not used in this country
(even with a   obtained by showing "probable cause") is
because we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency and
what is ethically and morally right.
     I  that the same question of expediency versus morality
 come into play when considering the use of Big Brother.  I
vote for morality.
     I am quite disturbed by what I interpret as a veiled threat
to prohibit the use of all encryption if this Big Brother chip is
not put into wide spread use.  After a quick reading of the White
House press release I came away with that impression.
     To most of the American public, the word "hacker" has
rightly or wrongly come to mean "high tech adolescent vandal".
It has struck me that most of the people posting to sci.crypt
regarding this issue are intelligent, thoughtful individuals who
have genuine concerns about the privacy and constitutional issues
surrounding Big Brother.  I hope that the use of Big Brother does
not become mandatory and other encryption become illegal.  I
 hate to see this become some kind of high tech Volstead
Act.
     The high speed digital communications revolution is coming
at us with the speed of an SST.  The times they are a changing,
and just as IBM is learning that they can't do business the same
way they have done it for the past 40 years, maybe NSA 
evaluate another approach.
     EFF, who have correctly questioned the cryptographic
strength of Big Brother, may need to send a stronger message out
regarding the constitutional issues involved.
     Al Gore may want to  this one through a little more.

   I was wanting to ask the same question Dan Bernstein asked--how does the
 chip exchange keys?  If the public key is only 80 or 160 bits long,
does anyone know of any public-key schemes that are secure with that key
size?  (Diffie-Hellman or maybe El Gamal, with p set to a constant value?)
   Presumably, the real scheme is something like:
 
   1.  Exchange/verify public keys.
   2.  Send encrypted (randomly-generated) session key.
   3.  Encrypt / Decrypt voice trafic with some sort of fast stream cipher.
 
   Can anyone elaborate on this, or show me what I'm missing here?

encryption algorithm so great it's TOP SECRET and so unbreakable
they WON'T EVEN LET YOU LOOK AT IT!

Doesn't that make you feel SECURE?

With all the talk about this  chip, I have developed one question...

			HOW DOES IT WORK???

If you use this, then how does it get decrypted on the other end? Does the
other party (receiving the phone call/mail/etc) have to know some code to 
undo it? Do I use a different method for calling one party than I  for 
another?. If the other party can decrypt it, doesn't that mean that someone
else could also? I assume that if everyone has a different key, the only use
 be storing secure data for later retrieval by the same key. This seems
like a fundamental question to me, but I have very little experience with
cryptosystems, other than DES. If someone could give me an explanation as
to how it  be used (remember that I have had little experience with
this sort of thing) it  be very much appreciated.

Here are some ideas for  of you who want to oppose the White
House  chip crypto initiative.  I  this is going to be a
tough measure to fight,  the Government has invested a lot of
resources in developing this high-profile initiative.  They are
serious about it now.  It won't be as easy as it was defeating Senate
Bill 266 in 1991.

Possible actions to take in response:

1)  Mobilize your friends to to all the things on this list, and
more.

2)  Work the Press.  Talk with your local newspaper's science and
technology reporter.  Write to your favorite trade rags.  Better yet,
write some  yourself for your favorite magazines or
newspapers.  Explain why the  chip initiative is a bad idea. 
Remember to tailor it to your audience.  The general public may be
slow to grasp why it's a bad idea,  it seems so technical and
arcane and innocent sounding.  Try not to come across as a flaming
libertarian paranoid extremist, even if you are one. 

3)  Lobby Congress.  Write letters and make phone calls to your
Member of Congress in your own district, as well as your two US
Senators.  Many Members of Congress have aides that advise them of
technology issues.  Talk to  aides.

4)  Involve your local political parties.  The Libertarian party
 certainly be interested.   are also libertarian wings of
the Democrat and Republican parties.  The right to privacy has a
surprisingly broad appeal, spanning all parts of the political
spectrum.  We have many natural allies.  The ACLU.  The NRA.  Other
activist groups that may someday find themselves facing a government
that can suppress them much more efficiently if  trends play
themselves out.  But you must articulate our arguments well if you
want to draw in people who are not familiar with  issues.

4)  Contribute money to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), assuming
 groups will fight this initiative.  They need money for legal
expenses and lobbying.

5)  Mobilize opposition in industry.  Companies that will presumably
develop products that will incorporate the  chip  be
lobbied against it, from within and from without.  If you work for a
telecommunications equipment vendor, first enlist the aid of your
coworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative, and then
present your company's management with a united front of engineering
talent against this initiative.  Write persuasive memos to your
management, with your name and your colleagues' names on it.  Hold
meetings on it.

6)  Publicize, deploy and entrench as much guerrilla
techno-monkeywrenching apparatus as you can.  That  PGP,
anonymous mail forwarding systems based on PGP, PGP key servers,
etc.  The widespread availability of this kind of technology might
also be used as an argument that it can't be effectively suppressed
by Government action.  I will also be working to develop new useful
tools for  purposes. 

7)  Be prepared to engage in an impending public policy debate on
this topic.  We  know yet how tough this fight will be, so we
may have to compromise to get most of what we want.  If we can't
outright defeat it, we may have to live with a modified version of
this  chip plan in the end.  So we'd better be prepared to
analyze the Government's plan, and articulate how we want it
modified.

It just occurred to me why the algorithm is secret.  If it were
published, one could then build physically identical clone versions
of the chip that  interoperate with official  chips.  But
the cloner n't provide the keys to the  houses.  Hmmn.

Or is  a technical hack that I've missed?  E.g. how about if the
chips were made unprogrammed but serialized, and then shipped to the
two  houses who programmed in  halves of the keys, but
in a way that requires that secret keys known only to the  houses
be installed as well, without which clone versions n't
interoperate?  This is getting awfully complicated, but that's
crypto for you.

  And in Russia, capitalists were persecuted for trading goods on the
black market. And in the US, capitalist minded types are imprisoned and killed
for things such as selling drugs, guns, pornography, and other victimless
activities.  It doesn't matter whether you are socialist or capitalist,
power and control are central to government.  citizens can't be trusted to
run  own affairs, the government must watch them.  (for 
own good of course. I mean, with strong cryptography, citizens might <gasp!>

  Not very surprising to anyone who believes in "hands off" government. If
you believe that your private life (both social and financial) are none of
anyone else's business, the difference between socialism and communism is
like the difference between murder by lethal injection or by
chainsaw. The more centralized the economy is, the more potential
abuses for accumulation of information on individuals. If you 
credit companies are bad, ...  Well, I'm sure a democratic socialist society
 vote for absolute privacy of all citizens -- NOT!

Given the description of the algorithm given, the only plausible

in advance by the two parties; i.e. it's a standard shared symmetric
key.

   Look! This is clearly the first step toward outlawing our

   tooth and nail, every step of the way, it'll be a crime to use
   screw threads other than  our Fearless Leaders so *graciously*
   define for us.

   Rubbish, I say! ANSI standard screw threads will have subtle weaknesses,

This is the one part that  scares me. Without
the keys, it can likely be determined if a person
is using the "State Approved" encryption method,
and if not then that persons life is forfet, and
the profits go to making more busts, and more

[... a bunch of well-meaning (maybe) cynnical text about screw-thread
	sizes, the rights of people to have  own standards,

Well, as funny as your little comment may seem, it has very little to
do with your personal privacy as a citizen, and about the governemnt
 able to look at everything you have ever typed into a computer
at one point or another.

This " Chip" stuff is the seeds for nightmares to make the 
Nightmare on Elmstreet cheese-on-celluloid movies look like episodes
of Mr. Roger's Neighborhood.

IF the gov establishes a cryptography standard that has to be used by
everyone, and everyone's personal key is divided into two segments
and stored at two separate, albeit easy to find places, and that key is
only 80 bits to begin with, we are screwed (pardon the allusion to the 
affore-mentioned )!

the gov, I believe, as do many others probably already have the cracking chips
for this  Chip made.  Hell, they probably based the encoder on the 
chip that cracks it, that way it's easier to break the code, but  it is a 
classified algorythm, no one knows that they can crack it so easily.

I, for one, and quite scared of this kind of thing, and plan to support 
s (and even diss) who are fighting against this
 Chip in any way that I can.

I do not want the government to be able to have access, even with a search
warrant, to my keys... and I  want  keys to be only 80 bits long
to begin with!

I envision incorporation of new standart into
various communication systems, thus making it prevalent on the market & 
theore cheap. The way to do that may be detaching crypto chip from 
communication equipment. It seems logical to provide  chip 
to the end-user not as a part of phone, fax, modem & like but in the
form of smart-card compatible with various telecomm. products. Banks 
will encourage extensive use of new cards to make transactions by phone.
Natural step will be to cross-erence this card to the person in the 
government databases - or else this new version of "wiretap proposal" 
make no sence at all; one wish to eavesdrop (spell.) on the particular 
person, not on the particular modem or phone.
 
As a side note, I disagree with one poster, who said he won't care about
ability of the government to eavesdrop,  they can do that now 
anyway.  will take away electronic survelliance from citizens, 
making it monopoly of the government. May be, we can find examples when
interceptions made by (unauthorised) people uncovered crimes of 
state officials ?

Some thoughts:

Has any work been done on encapsulating encrypted data inside "non-encrypted"
data files?  Many file formats can be written with "gaps" in them to hide
other data.  New file formats could be designed to have alternate data hidden
by dispersing it amongst the "legitimate" data.  The hidden data  only
show up with the right key(s), and a file with hidden data  be
indistinguishable from one without.  So, only the correct key(s)  reveal
the presence of an "illegal" document.

If I devise a custom file compression algorithm and only I and a friend have
the uncompressor, and otherwise the file appears to be total gigerish, do I
have the right to transmit the file?  Will we have to "" all our data
file formats?  Are gangs required to   hand signals, colors and
catch phrases?

I  that it's important to evaluate the content of electronic speach by
replacing the media with pen and paper or verbal speach and then re-ask the
question.

This is a very curious thing to say. STU-IIIs (NSA-designed secure
telephones cleared for classified traffic) are already readily
available to law enforcement agencies. Word has it they're standard in
every FBI office, for example.  Something like several hundred
thousand of  phones exist in all. They are clearly the US government
standard.

So why does the DoJ need to buy new phones that, unlike STU-IIIs, will
not be certified for classified traffic, and in all likelihood will
not be compatible with existing STU-IIIs?

Unless, of course, they're gearing up for large scale decryption of
civilian  users, and they need compatible hardware...

 has been extensive discussion in the eff forum, for example, about

The description of the chip's operation evidently leaves out some of the
key management aspects.  Either the K_P is the secret key corresponding
to a public key which is broadcast at message initiation, or it is the
result of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange or something similar.  Either
way  must be some protocols beyond  described here.  It isn't
clear whether they are implemented in the  wiretap chip or must

Via K_P, of course.  Nothing was said about where K_P comes from.  It's
the session key, though, and it's chosen however you usually choose
session keys --- exponential key exchange, shared secret, RSA, etc.
But however you choose it, the chip will apparently emit the 
header when you do.

   I  doubt that this will be the attitude of many corporate leaders.
It's understandable--most corporate execs  know much about cryptology,
and it's easy to get taken in by someone peddling snake oil.  And, the
proposed scheme *is* a major improvement in telephone security to what
exists now.
 
   The problem is that, with any security scheme of this kind, you have to
concern yourself with the weakest link in the chain.  I suspect that NSA
has put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of s,
probably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.  Unfortunately, the
existence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds of
possible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build (say)
a DES keysearch machine.
 
   As originally described, it sounded like any police /  combination
could acquire the key for a given chip.  I hope that's not the case, 
it  imply a glaring hole.  (How much does it cost to find *one* crooked
jodge and *one* crooked cop?  Especially for a foreign intelligence agency
or organized crime boss?)  However, even if more intelligent schemes are used
to allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations,  will be weak-
nesses.  They may be very expensive, and very difficult.  But who 
trust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that, for
(say) $100,000 could by cracked one time in a hundred?  (DES, for all the
complaints about a 56-bit key,  probably cost several million dollars
to build a keysearch machine for.)
 
   How many million dollars  the confidential phone messages of
the GM headquarters be worth to Nissan, Chrysler, or Audi?  How about
home phones of major execs and important engineers and designers?
"Gee, Mr Jones, I understand you've had some financial problems lately.
Maybe I can help..."
 
>>I'd trust something from the NSA long before I'd trust something from some
>>Swiss or anybody Japanese.
 
   Indeed, if NSA  designed the algorithm to be secure, it's very likely
as secure as IDEA or 2-key DES.  However, the system as a whole isn't resistant
to "practical cryptanalysis."  In _The Puzzle Palace_, Bamford describes how
several NSA employees were turned by foreign (presumably KGB) agents, despite
security measures that I doubt any Big 8 accounting firm could match.  And
NSA confidential data was *not*  to  requested by thousands of
police s and s across the land.

								Yeah!

	The algorithm is classified because a military contract (or similar
government equivalent to military) has been let for this "proprietary"
design that the Feds say that NSA developed.  Is  a patent?  Is that
patent publicly available?  My betting is that that too is classified.

	If the algorithm were made public, or reverse-engineered, it 
compromise not only the goal of Justice of  able to read every chip
users cypto-data but  reduce profits for the selected chip maker.

	n't that just be too bad?

   Not necessarily.  I've been ing about this, and if this chip/scheme
is to provide any real security,  must be some sort of key exchange,
either using a public-key encryption scheme, or using a key exchange scheme
like Diffie-Hellman.  If 's an out-of-band transmission of a shared
session key, then what protects that band from eavesdropping?  If the phone
company or some other online central authority generates a session key and
sends it to both users, then what's the point of going to the trouble of
having some complicated key-depositories?  Just ask the phone company for
a copy of the session key for each call.
 
   Now, it's probably not practical for each user to keep an online copy of
every public key used by anyone anywhere, right?  So, probably,  will
be some way of getting  keys verified.  This might be a digitally-
signed (by the chip manufacturer) copy of the public key in this unit,
stored by this unit.  It might also be an online directory with access to
everyone's public keys.  (This  introduce another weakness to the
security of the scheme, of course.)  Presumably, if you  use your

This isn't true.  Today's criminals regularly use all sorts of unsafe
methods, from cordless phones to cellular phones to plain old copper
wire analog phones that you can put alligator clips on to plan and
execute  crimes.

It is amazing how stupid they are, which is why the FBI was so keen on
the digital telphony law, and its successor the  chip.  They're
hoping here that most crooks will remain stupid, feel safe using 
chip phones and get caught.

   Perhaps one way of getting away from this cripple chip that the U.S.
government seems to be pushing  be to come up with a good alternative.
For example, how about a scheme using RSA, and some hybrid of DES-CFB and
another strong stream cipher (Maybe IDEA-CFB)?  This could be substantially
the same as the cripple chip, except that instead of key-registration, the
police could demand that you give up your secret key to them (with a -
issued warrant).  Then, they could read the last few months of wiretapped
messages you've sent, and assuming you've committed no crimes, you could
generate a new key pair and go about your business.  I find that I'd be
willing to pay RSA for the right to use such a system, especially given the
alternative.  If you were unwilling to give up your secret key, then you'd
probably stay in jail (has anyone got a real legal precedent for this?).
   This  allow -issued warrants to be used to gather information
on suspected criminals, but it couldn't be done in secrecy, and 
 be enormously less likelihood of corruption or theft of ed keys.
(Maybe someone from the law-enforcement or intelligent community will correct
me, but this doesn't *seem* like such a big loss in terms of law-enforcement
capabilities.)
 
   Any comments?

Oh? Hellman said ``each user will get to choose his or her own key.''
That's the key which I called K_P, the session key. According to
Hellman, if Alice and Bob are communicating with the  Chip,
then Alice chooses ``her own key'' and Bob chooses ``his own key.''
This is incompatible with the suggestion that when Alice and Bob are
talking, they use a _common_ K_P, chosen by classical or public-key
approaches.

The protocol/key-management description published so far is either
incomplete or incorrect. It leaves me with no idea of how the system
 actually _work_. I hope the CPSR FOIA request succeeds so that
we get full details.

One way to do this might be to suggest that  companies  be
implementing  own schemes, not  limited to the govt's
scheme.

I find that most of my reasons for opposition to the  scheme
are algoritm insecurity and mistrust of the govt/NSA.   are hard 
to sell in letters to the editor and to nontechnical people.  Any
hints or advice.  Maybe a small FAQ-type thing "Why  I Hate

I recall seeing a post some time ago saying that if the details of
an encryption scheme couldn't be revealed, then the encryption
scheme is worthless.  I believe the statement was in response to
somebody saying that they had some new snazzy scheme, but the
algorithm was a secret.

Does this algorithm depend on the fact that the scheme is secret or
is it for the stated reasons above?

  The idea that foisting the Cripple Chip standard on US manufacturers 
result in saying "Sayonara" to yet another high-tech market isn't technical,
isn't in the least difficult to understand, and plays on a concern lots of
people are worried about already....

It's  very feasible and n't be too expensive - all that's needed
is a box with a phone jack on one side, a DSP in the middle to do codec
functions of speech->compressed bytestream, and an RS232 on the other side.

You'd plug your phone into it, plug the RS232 into your computer, and have
a good old fashioned normal modem on your other RS232 port.  The CPU in the
middle  do the encryption with a version of pgp modified to work on
a byte stream.

With v32bis or better modems to carry the bytestream, it  work. 
Quality  only be marginally lower than a normal telephone.

At the very highest price, you could use one of  voice-mail compatible
modems to do the digitisation - that puts an upper bound of about $500 on
the cost of such a box.  In practice, you  ought to be able to get
the price well below $100 - I could do it now in software on my cheap&nasty
home RISC box (Acorn Archimedes) with the digitising microphone I bought
for 25 pounds, if I knew how to write good speech compression software
(which I ).

The reason it won't work of course is that hardly anyone will have one -
the only consumer equipment to have encryption will use the wiretap chip.
Economics, I'm afraid.

However... we can get about 2Kcps throughput on the internet even with
the bottleneck of a v32bis modem.  When we get ISDN for all (ha ha ha)
and the new NREN, it might then be trivial to run compressed speech
over a tcp/ip connection on the Internet.  Perhaps we  start
ing now of a standard to keep voice on the internet compatible
for everyone, and side-step the  stuff and use internet for
all our phone calls in future :-)  [1/2 joking]

2^40 doesn't sound that big - is digital telephony  to a known

I can buy a DES keysearch machine off the shelf now for approx $500K, but
it is not sold by that name. Go buy a circuit emulation machine (eg. Quickturn)
containing a bunch of FPGAs, (say 500 to 1000 3090's), and program each
to be a DES search engine. Lets say 500 chips, running at 10Mhz = 5G tests/sec.
Time is 14e6 sec max = 23 weeks, 12 weeks average. Can't wait that long?
Buy a bigger machine.

 was an interesting column on the editorial page of the Dallas
Morning News on Saturday by Walter Williams, who I believe is a
professor at Georgetown (I wonder if he knows of Dorothy "you're not in

eroding our liberties", and in it he tells a story attributed to the
late Leonard Read who

        explained that if you wanted to take liberty away from
        Americans, you had to know how to cook a frog.  Mr. Read
        said you can't cook a frog by boiling a pot of water and
        then throwing the frog in.  His lexes are so quick that
        as soon as his feet touch the water, he will leap away.
        You must put the frog in a pot of cold water and heat it
        up bit by bit.  By the time the frog realizes he's 
        cooked, it is too late.  It is the same with Americans.

I must respectfully disagree with this assertion, Brad.  The government is
notoriously sloppy with physical, communications, and information security.  They
can't keep  computers safe, and they're "trying".  Read "DEA is
Not Adequately Protecting National Security Information" [GAO/IMTEC 92-31] for an
excellent example of what I'm talking about.

Private sector s tend to be even more lax in  security measures.
I believe that the  s will be penetrated by foreign
intelligence services within months, if not weeks, of  selection.  Private
s that lack the resources of a full-fleged intelligence service will
take longer - perhaps on the  of one to two years.  Nonetheless, the
penetrations will take place, without question.

I am sure that -you-  be happy to use anything "they" tell you is
secure; we're talking about the intelligent people here... Or the
criminal ones, if you  like the previous sentence... :-) Or 
who  want  privacy to be guaranteed to be invadable by the

Even if you ignore the nonsense of the above statement for a moment,
and even if you are happy with such system and the current 
agencies NOW, what guarantees that you'll be happy with them TOMORROW,
when the government changes? Or when the current government throws
away the sheep skin? All the sheep who are reasoning like you will get
caught by surprise, but it will be too late, because then cryptography
that is not guaranteed to be breakable by the government will already
have been outlawed... After all, you've already got privacy that is
said to be breakable only by the law enforcement agencies, so if you
are law-abiding, you have no reasons to use a stronger one, right? So,
if you are using a stronger one, you have something to hide from the
law enforcement agencies, right? Something unlawful, right? Theore,
strong crypto is a clear idndication that you are doing something
unlawful.

> I'd trust the NSA or the President if they stated  were no trap

Considering the level of competence in cryptology that you have
demonstrated in your messages, you  trust just anything... And
no, this is not an ad hominem attack; it's an attack against the
contents of your messages <grin>.

> doors--I'd be even happier if a committee of independent experts examined

And how do you know that  experts are not corrupted? And how do
you know that they will not make a mistake? And how do you know that
the version of the algorithm they will be let to examine is the same
as the one that will be  used?

Regarding the mistake - even the few information "they" have let out
has revealed a serious security hole in the protocol - the 80-bit key
is split in two 40-bit ones, thus the whole system is easily
breakable, if you have only one of the keys.

The Swiss or the Japanese are motivated by simple greed; NSA is
motivated by  wish to control the people. That's why the drug
dealers have  accounts in Swiss banks, instead of in American
ones. For some reason, they do trust the Swiss banks more... Guess
they'll trust the Swiss encryption more too... I see IDEA becoming
suddenly popular... :-)

It's not surprising at all, but not because of the reason you give.
It's because it is obvious that the US government has put a lot of
money behind this program and it will support it. Thus, most
corporations will try to get  piece from the pie by supporting it
too. The same good old greed. Strong encryption is not widely
available now not because of some plot, but because the companies
 see much money in it. It will be available even less, if the
companies can see any penalties associated with it...

Yeah, just as I predicted, you are here again, to support the new
system.

Agreed. No agency such as the NSA (or whoever)  approve the public 
release of a crypto-system, if they didn't already have the technical
 or the know-how to decrypt everything at  whim. Surely the whole
point of all this madness is to make Joe Public  that his/her
communications will be kept safe,  James Bond at the NSA can, if need
be, have full, decrypted access to someone's communications? That'll be
quite a heist, if they can pull it off. 


I thought that the US Government were going to release the algorithm to a
panel of "caully chosen experts", who  then "study it deeply, and
report  findings"? Exactly who will  people be? Academics? Or
Government-sponsored researchers? Tiny-toons?

I can only hope that the same sort of thing doesn't start filtering over

wind of it, well, we can kiss goodbye to any form of Democracy in Europe

As usual,  Sternlight is demonstrating his inability to read. The
proposal clearly states:

=> The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
=> accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
=> telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.

It speaks about telecommunications in general. Read it again, .
Maybe you'll understand it the next time... Nah, probably not.

That's exactly what the government wants all sheep-minded people to
. Let's look at the current situation. It allows to almost
anybody to eavesdrop almost everybody, unless secure (and I mean
secure) encryption is used. What will happen when ("if"? Ha!
optimists...) the new proposal gets accepted? Almost nobody EXCEPT
SOME will be able to eavesdrop everybody else, but the ability of
 "some" to eavesdrop will be guaranteed! The proposal emphasizes
on the former ("almost nobody") - which is clearly an improvement -
and "forgets" to mention the drawbacks of the latter ("guaranteed").
Yes, my statement assumes that the next step will be to make the
strong crypto unlawful. You  that it will not happen? Good luck.

> Note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap.

It's not just "continued ability". It's -guaranteed- ability.

Yeah, that's exactly what your government wants you to . Let's
take small steps, one at a time. Concentrate on the current one, 
 about the future. Trust us.

> One question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is

It's not asked because the proposal clearly says that this is the
intention. They, unlike you, read what they write.

Yes, it will. It will stop the jerk who is eavesdropping now. It will
allow only to the government to eavesdrop. (If the scheme is secure,
of course, which is yet to be proven.) But how do you know that the
jerk you are fearing now will not get a government job tomorrow? The
new proposal -guarantees- him the ability to eavesdrop then. Hell,
that will even motivate him to get that job - if he indeed is that
mentally pervert...

Great. The Greatest Cryptographer of All Times  Sternlight (tm)
has succeeded to evaluate the new system in the absense of any
details whatsoever and has concluded that it is "highly secure". I
guess, that comes from the background of working some 50 years for the
two major crypto evaluating companies, right? Gee, now the government
can save all that money and trouble to ask a secret council of crypto
experts to secretly analyse the new secret method - for 
Sternlight has already done all the job for them...

The main question is to guarantee to availability of -- secure
cryptography to the masses. Gee, if the proposal was saying "we
guarantee that every American will  have the full right to use
any kind of encryption s/he  like and regard this proposal as
just a default, voluntary implementation",   have been much
less opposition... For some reason, they didn't even try to promise
you that. I wonder why... Was Orwell off only by 10 years?

No, in return you get crypto that is guaranteed to be crippled.

 the above is just rumors, and  even if it is true, it is
not done -easily-, the new scheme can is guaranteed to be easily
breakable by anybody who has the two keys. It might be also breakable
by somebody who does not have them but knows the right trick. Or who
has only one of them. NSA also told you that DES is secure, why 
you simply trust them, huh?

It is -guaranteed- to be -easily- breakable - just get the keys. It
might be even easier, but until  is some evidence, this is just a
wild speculation.

Legitimate? And who decides what communications are legitimate? Oh, I

It's kinda if I have the keys from your car and I am asked to decide
who has the right to use it "legitimately"...

Here are some corrections and additions to Hellman's note, esy of
Dorothy Denning.  Again, this is reposted with permission.

Two requests -- first, note the roles of S1 and S2.  It appears to me
and others that anyone who knows  values can construct the unit
key.  And the nature of the generation process for K1 and K2 is such
that neither can be produced alone.  Thus, the scheme cannot be
implemented such that one repository generates the first half-key, and
another generates the second.  *That* is ominous.

Second --  postings are not revealed scripture, nor are they
caully-crafted spook postings.   attempt to draw out hidden
meanings (as opposed to, say, the official announcements of ).
Leave Denning out of this; given Hellman's record of opposition to DES,
which goes back before some folks on this newsgroup knew how to read, I
  you can impugn his integrity.

Oh yeah -- the folks who invented  aren't stupid.  If you 
something doesn't make sense, it's almost certainly because you 
understand  goals.

: Re:   Chip
To: (a long list of folks)

I was also briefed by the NSA and FBI, so let me add a few comments to
Marty's message:

        The  Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in 

The algorithm operates on 64-bit blocks (like DES) and the chip supports
all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm uses 32 rounds of scrambling
compared with 16 in DES.

	In addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his 
	or her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key 
	plain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be 

K is the session key shared by the  and receiver.  Any method
(e.g., public key) can be used to establish the session key.  In the
AT&T telephone security devices, which will have the new chip, the key
is negotiated using a public-key protocol.
 
	encrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK, 
	and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part 
	message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK 
	producing

	     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}

My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the
"family key") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by
law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?  I
will also check it out, but this is 7am Sunday so I did not want to wait.

        The unit key 
	will be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 
	and K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two  

The unit key, also called the "chip key," is generated from the
serial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks
derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.
Compute the 64-bit block

(Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with
two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.
(I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that
they're called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are
concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and
the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.

I've received so far include SRI, Rand, Mitre, the national labs (Sandia,
LANL, Los Alamos), Treasury, GAO.

Instead of reading between the , try to  a little bit. OK,
if that's way too difficult to you, here are some hints.

Indeed, the new proposal imposes some additional burocratic burden on
the local police, if they badly want to tape the magic cookie recipie
that your mom is telling you on the phone. So, guess what they will
do? Propose that the new technology is removed? Or implement some
"facilitations"? Of course, you won't want to wait until they get the
approval from two different agencies to decrypt the conversation
between two child molesters, because mean  two child
molesters might be conspiring about molesting your child, right? So,

I've been asked to supply more specific directions
for automated fetching of the source and documentation
for "agrep," the powerful similarity pattern matching tool.

It is at

cs.arizona.edu
192.12.69.5

in directory

/agrep/README
/agrep/agrep-2.04.tar.Z
/agrep/agrep.ps.1.Z
/agrep/agrep.ps.2.Z

(The .ps suffixed files are the optional postscript docs; 
a reasonably good research report with benchmarks is
included.)

Note for Macintosh MPW users: after a few hours of drudgery,
I ported the tool to MPW 3.2.3 running under System 7.1.
If you  like me to e-mail a binhexed copy of the tool
suitable for dropping in to your MPW/tools folder, please write...

Other than the more purely cryptographic uses for the tool
I've been having lots of fun picking up the "lost"
 to things I'm interested in. For example,
starting a search like:

agrep -1 -i 'Burning Chrome' cyberpunkspool 

immediately finds  like 'burning crome' that I
have always missed before.  See how many times John
Gilmore's name is mentioned in the CUD archives
(and how often misspelled).  How about _your_ name?

As usual, I will e-mail the uuencoded tar.Z upon request
if you cannot do anonymous FTP.

  Misinterpretation, though it  be a crime in itself, is what
United States lawyers use to make  bread and butter.

  In Manchester, CT a few years ago, a small company wanted to run a
game system galled "LaserGames," similar in many aspects to Photon
(tm). Three lawyers and about a hundred citizens found an ancient law
in Manchester's books which clearly from context was designed to
prohibit travelling carnivals by enumerating the features of a carnival
which they felt at the time made the prohibition obvious. Among 
things was "shooting galleries," which is what the lawyers for the
opposition to LaserGames wanted to harp upon. The judge took the two
words from this law, completely out of context, and ruled that
LaserGames could not operate in Manchester.

  Keep in mind that most travelling carnivals use projectile weapons in
 shooting galleries, and not light beams. Clearly from context,
LaserGames got shafted, but if the two words are applied,  denial
of operating permission was justified.

  If I had the text of the law I'd post it, but I'm afraid I 
remember it all well enough to even try. That little bit with the two
words stuck well, though.

: * REPORT ON PRIVACY-PROTECTING OFF-LINE CASH AVAILABLE *
: <9618@charon.cwi.nl>
Date: 19 Apr 93 14:37:17 GMT

I recently published a new privacy-protecting off-line electronic cash
system as a technical report at CWI.  a PhD-student at 
Chaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research
in the field of privacy-protecting cash systems.

The report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z, contains 77 pages, and can be
retrieved from

ftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)

from the directory pub/CWIreports/AA.
The postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.

====================================================================
ABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cash
system based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which
little use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the
first to be based entirely on discrete logarithms.  Using the
representation problem as a basic concept, some techniques are
introduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and
payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier
systems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in
both computation and communication complexity than any such system
proposed previously.
  
Another important aspect of our system concerns its provability.
Contrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be
mathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if we
make one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the
ability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the
Diffie-Hellman problem. 
  
Our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in
previously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of 
is that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be
incorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has
the important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the
first place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender
after the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under the
most stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user,
which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems.
Another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have
negligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by
a simple mechanism from within the system, which is something that
previous solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash system
can be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, 
retaining its computational efficiency.
====================================================================

Cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system!  

I made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as
possible.  Nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail to
me and I will try to reply as good as I can. Any comments are also
welcome!

I have also been in contact with Mitch about this. I believe
him when he says he didn't ask to be on the "" list.

He also forwarded the traffic he had recieved through that list to
me which will be placed at some ftp site.

However, the first alias on the " list" was csspab which was

Not necessarily --- they could release the details of the algorithm
without releasing the "system key" (called SK by Hellman).  That 
make most people happy, and with some sort of verification procedure
before key exchange, the "official" chips  only work with other
"official" chips.  In other words, secrecy of SK makes "physically
identical clone versions" impossible;  secrecy of the algorithm n't
be necessary.

Of course, revealing the algorithm opens them up to attacks on SK ---
 all units share this key, compromising it may be a big deal.
Personally, I n't feel too comfortable knowing that one "secret"
80-bit number held in many places was all that guaranteed my security.
Of course, compromise of SK doesn't necessarily mean that the system
is compromised, but it's impossible to tell whether or not that's true
with a secret algorithm.

Incidentally, what's to keep a "secret algorithm" from using the secret
SK as the main key, with UK  only marginally important.  Then
a   for UK may not even be necessary to do a wiretap.

I understand, believe it or not, and  are any number of kinds of 
conversation and communication I engage in that I n't even consider 
using this scheme for.  On the other hand, I  see "" as providing 
a secure channel--it just prevents casual eavesdropping.  This is part of why 
I am not worried about it per se.  Trying to look at  as a serious 
security tool is simply ludicrous.  It's a voice scrambler, nothing more.

They cost an arm and a leg, though. "" is obviously aimed at the mass 
market.  It certainly won't put Cylink out of business.

This is old news.  I can do this now.

 ARE restrictions.  Example: We're a networking software vendor with a 
large overseas share of our market.  We cannot currently ship PEM, or even 
simple DES, in our products without case-by-case approval from the Department 
of State.  ITAR presents a material trade barrier to US firms trying to 
compete in international information systems markets.

Sure, you can use whatever freebie software you want to talk over BBS's in 
the USA.  I, on the other hand, want strong crypto (PKCS, for example) to be 
the *default* for electronic mail, worldwide.  I want priests to be able to 
hear confession over email.  I want lawyers to be able to talk to clients in 
confidence over email, or doctors talk with patients.  I want to be able to 
 products from my favorite Japanese mail- catalog over the net.  I 
want to be able to sign contracts, transact business, and so on 
electronically.

This is so far infeasible as a result of the current restrictions on 
crytographic systems, especially beyond the bs of the USA.

 is irrelevant, and if it distracts the authorities into feeling safe, 
all the better.  Its only danger is if it emboldens them into trying to put 
more restrictions into place, on the theory that it is "good enough for 
anyone who has nothing to hide."  That argument is, of course, utter BS, just 
as much as "no one needs an assault rifle".

I am sure that Mike is correct on this point.  I am also pretty sure that

Both drawing blood and injecting "truth serum" incapacitate you for

( Below is my response to Dr. Denning's letter to Steven Bellovin. Comments
  are invited. - Paul )

In alt.privacy., Steve Bellovin posted your message to
him, which included a brief passage concerning selection of agencies
as  agencies.

I am glad to see that the proposal as written states that the 
agencies won't be law enforcement agencies. I  argue, however,
that *one* of the  agencies n't be federal at all.

As a private citizen, I  feel much more "secure in my person and
papers" knowing that an  committed to individual civil
liberties- the ACLU and the NRA come to mind- was safeguarding half of
my key. Both the ACLU and the NRA are resistent to government pressure
by the simple expedient fact that they are not supported, funded, or
overtly controlled by the government.

Of  federal and federally funded candidate agencies that you
mentioned, I have the following comments:

	- SRI, Rand, Mitre, and national labs: I agree that they have
        great experience safeguarding sensitive information. I am not
        convinced that they  adequately safeguard _this_
	information,  in any case requiring disclosure, 's
      	likely to be sigificant pressure for disclosure- possibly
 	*wrongful* disclosure.

	- GAO: perhaps. I  like to see more concrete evidence of
 	 fidelity and ability.

	- *TREASURY*? Surely you're joking. Perhaps you'd ask BATF
	to safeguard keys. Maybe the Federal Reserve  be a 
	better choice.

Ever  last fall's "trial balloon" was posted in sci.crypt, your
name has been synonymous with  who place a great deal of trust in
the ability of government agencies and agents to act within the law.

I agree with you in part:  agencies and agents *almost always*
act properly. However,  have been enough cases where _sworn
agents of the Federal Government_ have acted wrongly to make me feel
that having two federal agencies as key repositories is unacceptable.

topics devoted to gun rights issues, you will find ample evidence that
the "misinformation" is your assertion that the term "the people" in
the Second Amendment has mysteriously taken on a meaning diametrically

: Re:   Chip

I just had another conversation with NSA to clarify some of the features
of .  Please feel free to distribute this and my other messages
on .

The name of the encryption algorithm is "Skipjack."

Martin Hellman had written

                and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part
                message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK
                producing

                     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}

To which I responded:

        My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the
        "family key") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by
        law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?

I was correct in that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK.  However, Skipjack
 a single-key system,  is, of course, not a separate decrypt key
for the family key SK.

        The unit key, also called the "chip key," is generated from the
        serial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks
        derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.
        Compute the 64-bit block

                R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1]

        (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with
        two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.
        (I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that
        they're called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are
        concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and
        the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.

The seeds S1 and S2 do not change.   The whole process is performed on
a laptop computer, and S1 and S2 are supplied by two independent people
so that no one person knows both.  The same S1 and S2 are used during
an entire "programming session" to generate keys for a stream of serial
numbers.  Everything is discarded at the end (the computer could be
thrown out if desired).

The serial number is 30 bits and the values N1, N2, and N3 are formed
by padding the serial number with fixed 34-bit blocks (separate padding
for each value).

The resulting keys K1 and K2 are output onto separate floppy disks, paired
up with  serial number.  Each pair is stored in a separate file.  The
floppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the two
 agencies.

I just  this is an valuable addition to the less than technical

S1 and S2 'backdoor', as I could imagine the key-generation process
working without  seeds and the dependency of K1,K2 from the
Serial-Number.

	Are you sure you aren't  watched?  Let me remind you that 
Watergate was only the tip of the iceberg.  Nixon extensively used the NSA
to watch people because he didn't like them.  According to _Decrypting the
Puzzle Palace_:

	Presumably, the NSA is restricted from conducting American surveillance
	by both the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978(FISA) and a
	series of presidential directives, beginning with one issued by
	President Ford following Richard Nixon's bold misuse of the NSA, in
	which he explicitly directed the NSA to conduct widespread domestic
	surveillance of political dissidents and drug users.

	Of course, just because  are laws saying the gov't is not 
supposed to conduct illegal surveillance doesn't mean  laws can't be
broken when they are in the way.

You can find the salient difference in any number of 5th amendment
related Supreme  opinions. The  limits 5th amendment
protections to what they call "testimonial" evidence, as opposed to
physical evidence.

The whole question  hinge on whether a crypto key  be
considered "testimonial" evidence. I suppose arguments could be made
either way, though obviously I  hope it  be considered
testimonial.

Let me see if I have this straight --- if a person knows S1 and S2,
and the serial number of the unit, it's easy to reconstruct UK.
Of course, if they know SK, the "family key", they can easily get the
serial number of any unit that has made a transmission.  So with S1 and
S2  used for a  "batch" of the unit keys, the number of
used S1/S2 pairs will probably be fairly low.  Of course, you have to
believe that the NSA/FBI/name-your-favorite-government agency will
know SK so all it needs is the S1/S2 pairs, and presto, nasty details 
like  s for wire taps are no longer necessary.

Now, I'm not one of the people who distrusts the government at every
turn, but taking someone's word for it that the S1/S2 pairs are not kept
around is pushing what I'm willing to believe just a little bit too far.

If we do not trust the NSA to be a registrar of  Chip key halves,
I  not trust Mitre either.  Mitre does lots of work for NSA, at least
in the Trusted Product Evaluation Program (evaluation of commercial off the
shelf software for its efficacy in safeguarding classified information), and
I assume in other, less open, programs.

 are at least two other FFRDCs (Federally Funded Research and Development
Corporations) that work for NSA: Aerospace Corporation and the Institute for
Defense Analysis.  Now, if NSA were to be untrustworthy (a position that I
am neutral about, for purposes of this posting), it  be in a position to
exert economic pressure upon Mitre to release key halves on demand.  It could
just say, "If you  cooperate with us, we'll place all our evaluation
contracts with Aerospace and IDA."

I am not saying that people at NSA, Mitre, Aerospace, or IDA are dishonest
folk.  But  they are people, and people occasionally go bad, the
system works better if s that you are depending upon to be
independent  are.

And, of course, I speak for myself, not my employer.

   admissible evidence.  This might put a stop to such things, which must from
   time to time be simple fishing expeditions.

Far more likely,  things will continue to be done no matter what
assurances we are given. "Key " is likely going to prove to be a
joke.

Hmm, followup on my own posting... Well, who cares.

First let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the
-Chip, from what Hellman and Denning were able to tell us:

The chip itself is not confined to (digital) telephony, but performs
general encryption in a symmetric manner.  The chip supports CFB OFB
ECB (and whatever the fourth mode of operation for DES is), the algorithm
consists of 32 rounds of *whatever*, and takes 80-Bit keys. Input data
seems to be 64 Bit? Yes.
So if two people want secure communication (whatever that  when 
 is involved) they have first to agree on ONE secret key. 
(Or is it one key per direction ?)
They can exchange this key via DH-schemes or however.
Somehow the two feed  so won secret key into the -chip
which is now ready to work.
The  chip carries an unique Serial-Number (30 Bit's), and 160 Key-Bits.
 160 key-bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial-number
with 160 seed-bits. (The seed-bits seem not to be stored in the chip)
At beginning of communication (and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin??)
before sending the fist real 64-bit output of the first encryption the 
chip put's out packets (I guess 3) which represent the serial number,
and the session key. This might look like
X{ E[K; chipkeyK1+K2], serial number}
where X is a transformation of  3? Packets involving a family-key.
This family(sp?)-key is equal for ALL chips. (X might be a simple XOR ???)
After that, the (digital?) phone-call can be done as usual, every packet
 encrypted and decrypted by .

Denning describes how K1 and K2 shall be generated, using a seed of 160
Bit's.

Now, leaving alone politics, which does not concern me as much as you, not
 an American Citicien(tm) [ :-) ] ,  are some weak points in this
scheme, which might be exploited by several parties.

As far as I know about the generation of K1,K2 ; S1 and S2 look like the 
obvious backdoor. They could be used to generate the chip-keys by knowing
the serial-number (and also the family-key) of the chip. I  can't
imagine why  seeds  be needed otherwise, as true random-sources
for the generation of the K1,K2 can be bought for not to much money.

Then, the s. Each of them will get 80 bit of a 160-Bit key. Security
could (as little as existant) be maximized by giving them 160-bits
each, which have to be xored together to give the K1,K2. Now let's simply
assume the s are trustworthy, and can't be fooled by criminals or
law enforchemnt agencies. (And  will be no quarrel between s
and l.e.a which  hinder the l.e.a in doing  duties, and so on
and so on) Once the keys are surrendered, the corresponding
chip is compromised forever. Not very clever, IMHO [ :-)) ].
How about sending in the encrypted session-keys for each phone-call that
the police (or whoever) want's to listen to? s could then simply decode
this session-key and send it back to police. (And  naturally not do this
after the warrant has expired...) This  be a better technical solution,
but I guess politics will not work that way.

Apparently (as Miss Dennings stated) the only one performing actually decodes
of intercepted messages shall be the FBI. Great. So local guys can not inter-
cept (understand) your traffic anymore. Does this mean that the FBI monopolizes
the right to do legal wiretaps ? (How is law over , I have no idea who
is allowed to tap, and who not) This certainly  that watched communi-
cations will be routed automatically from the service-providing company
to the FBI, if the communicaiton is a watched one. And this  as far
as I understand it that the family-key has to be known by each switching-
company, and  providing cellular-phone servies etcetc. So the family-key
will not be very secret, and thus serial-numbers of calls will be readable
by anybody who cares. I _like_ traffic-analysis!

What do you guess, what happens, if you use the chip in ECB mode, and the
first few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled? So the session
key  not be actually broadcasted over the line? Hmmm. n't be so
difficult to do *that* :^)

And now a last point, for the other side. After all I have read and heard about
 (not the programming language for dBase, is it ? [:-)]) it seems
to have many advantages, which shold not be overseen!


Now an afterthought to your rights. Please note that I have no idea what I am
talking about!!!

If this text is actually in your Bill of Rights, who can overrule this ?

Maybe you need to extend your Amendment #4  to cover information and

I wholeheartedly agree.  Knowing that WE have let our law enforcement agencies
seize our property against the Fifth Amendment of OUR Constitution tells me that
we are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for SELF-GOVERNANCE.  WE have
to take our government back from the self-serving politicians who create laws
and rules only to better  positions within the government.  WE have allowed
them to take too much power from the people of this nation.  That situation has
to be changed.

Allowing the law enforcement agencies to use the seized property to pay-off drug
informants who lie and continue to deal in drugs is tantamount to making a pact
with the Devil himself.  It's a vicious cycle.  The law enforcement agencies are
motivated to seize property to fund  own activities.  And having no easy
way for the citizen to regain the property intact once taken gives even more
incentive for the agencies to take property.

It's also interesting to note that two months ago Rush Limbaugh said that
Clinton  have the "plumbers" out in force shortly.  Clinton and his
henchmen firmly believe in strong ubiquitous government control.  Anytime a
leader believes in that, the leader will use every  possible to retain that
control and take more.

WE have to take OUR government back.  Otherwise we will end up living in the
equivalent of a high-tech third world dictatorship.  We have to take
responsibility for ourselves, our personal welfare, and our actions.

Telephone encryption and scrambleing are years behind digital ones like RSA,
IDEA, or even DES. The above,  literaly true, is a clasic straw-man claim
in the context of non-real-time circuits such as E-mail and the like.

Note the use of the word "business" in the above. The whole tenor of this
release seems to be establishing a ground rule that only "business" use
is legitimate for debate. If you want the nothings you drop in your wife's
ear to remain secret and private, that is not even on the agenda for debate.
Note that  is NO role for you to contain private info in this. The only
erence is to information already in the hands of others. The 'unauthorized
release' bit is also drawing a long bow. Most of  cases are by people who
have legitimate access abusing it, and revealing, or often selling the info.
 people are, of course, in this proposal, the people who will have the
keys.

The criminals also use lawers, s, the CIA, white-house officials and pens
to go about  business. When will they be outlawed as well? Yeah, several
of them  be a better idea than !

Them again, the protections of law and the s have been seriously erroded
over the last decade ofr so.

Note the repeated mixing of telephone scrabeling and encryption. A demo

The case record seems to indicate that what is needed is a brutal tightening
of the current abuses. I have not heard, yet, of a case that was impeaded by
the use of secure encryption by the men in black. The other side, abuse by law
enforcers is well documented, even by govt agencies. And the phone vs other coms
is blurred yet again.

Lets run that line twice. Not **VERY** caully what it says. The stated
purpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of  compulsory. Note the
word "ensure". As to 'protect', or 'law-abiding', I will leave to you.
So to the person who asked if it included the outlawing of other encryptions,
the answer in this press release is, YES.

Where do you find many experts. Any ex KGB people looking for a contract? :-)
And as a later posting asks, what of the STU-IIIs they already have. It will
be very interesting to see if the military and US embasies start to use it.
After all, it is secure, isn't it. The govt will answer that point by its own
actions.

Encryption and codes have been around for millenia. They are generaly in
equilibrium with the technology of the time. The systematic study of cyphers
has resulted in a swing in favor of the encrypter, AT THE MOMENT. I have no
doubt that the factoring problem will fall in time. Probably fofr practical
purposes by the middle of the next century.

This link between the security of the key-eschrow, and the actual algorithm is 
a real winner. Given that I have 2 secret 40 bit numbers, could someone please

I  say "less secure, less conveniant, more expensive ( PGP is free ),

They  seem to be saying anything that makes much sense. And this proposal

The 'false tension' is false. The balance is between two repugnant points. The
RIGHT to privacy is hand-waved to non-existance by putting it behind the "false
assessment". It is assumed that the removal of the right to take what ever steps
YOU deem suitable to protect YOUR privacy is non negotiable, hence is defined
in the govenment language to be non-existant. If you  agree, you must be a
criminal, as only criminals  agree with out laws. Also note the non-
question. "If what is here was not possible..."

This one is a real giggle. In Australia or France, they will have to reveal the
keys, and the algorithm.   it's at the top of my list of things I must
have, so the restrictions will protect me from saleks trying to sell me a bill
of crock.

Any for any others using it, they must be nuts!

The system, or 'family', key  appear to be cryptographically
useless,  *every* chip must know it and be able to remove its
effects from the bitstream.  I daresay that it will be widely known
almost immediately after this system is deployed, and  it's been
pointed out that  is not a separate decrypt key -- the same key
is used for both encryption and decryption --  goes any benefit
to the use of a system-wide key in SkipJack.

   The Second and Fourth Amendments do come to mind.  

The Second Amendment is especially apt, given the ITAR definitions of
crypto equipment as munitions, and the gun-control people's increasing
ability to define things as "assault weapons" and make them illegal.
Triple-DES is obviously used for "assault phones", 
Cripple will be legal, and Triple-Cripple may fall into the gray area
of "illegally upgrading to an assault phone"...

Read the Constitution yourself.  The Second Amendment says the right to bear

They didn't say that.  They said is was better than some commercial-grade

release the algorithm for investigation.

It always amazes me how quick people are to blame whatever
administration is current for things they couldn't possibly have
initiated.  This chip had to take *years* to develop, yet already
we're claiming that the Clinton administration sneaked it in on us.
Bullshit.  The *Bush* administration and the career Gestapo were
responsible for this horror, and the careerists presented it to the
new presidency as a fait accompli.  That doesn't excuse Clinton and
Gore from criticism for  so stupid as to go for it, but let's lay
the body at the proper door to start with.

You  care that people are  lied to, fooled into believing
the chip gives "privacy" when it fact it allows wiretaps?  You
 give a shit about anybody's privacy except your own?  (And
not even your own; are you so smart that you know when you're talking to
somebody who has a wiretap chip on  phone instead of a privacy
chip with private keys?)

"Simply?" "Everyone"  have this attitude?   The only people
who can have this attitude are the most hard-core
computer hackers, who never make phone calls away from 
computer, who apparently never call anybody except another computer 
hacker, or perhaps another spook (U.S. classified agents use to use
 own system, only oblivious civilian dupes get that dubious privilege).
Only spooks and hard-core hackers need privacy, huh?

We *do* need an alternative to NSA-bugged telephones, but
we're talking inexpensive *telephones* here, including hand-sized
cellulars, that need strong crypto, real privacy.  Make-shift
computer hacker rigs that require living by your computer to
talk privately over the phone are just a dumb stunt that doesn't 
do anything for anybody's privacy in the real world.  

What we need is a true *privacy chip*.  For example, a real-time 
voice-encryption RSA, put it into a silicon compiler and spit out ASIC.  
Put this chip on the market as a de facto standard for international 
business, diplomats, and private communications.  If the U.S. bans 
it, we make it somewhere else and import it.  The Japanese, German,
Dutch, Taiwanese, Korean, etc. electronics companies  want the 
NSA spying on them.  U.S. workers lose more jobs to government fascist
stupidity.

The final stages of denial... I can hardly imagine what the result
 have been if the Clinton administration had actually supported
this plan, instead of merely acquiescing with repugnance as they've so
obviously doing.  I  believe the chip originated with the Clinton
administration either, but the Clinton administration has embraced it
and brought it to fruition.

Both of the major parties have what they consider excellent reasons
for limiting your freedoms and violating your privacy, and even seem
to feel that they're doing you a favor.  If this is  surprising
to anyone it  they've been willfully ignoring quite a bit of
previous evidence.  's only one political party (not calling
anarchists a party) that considers your freedom and privacy goals
worthy in and of themselves.  If you're voting for the big two, you're
supporting a reduction of  rights (given  goals and 
histories), regardless of whether you personally support that
reduction.  To paint Clinton and Gore as unwitting tools is 
stretching things.

    No kidding.  The most recent post I saw in alt.privacy. (and I
hope anyone interested in this topic ends up ) states that 
has been in development for over four years.

    I am, however, more than a little PO'd that Clinton put his name on
this monstrosity, or even allowed it to get out the door, for that matter.
He's already heard from me, and I hope you'll all take the time to voice
your extreme displeasure as well.

I have a question that is a slight variation on the previously mentioned
examples that perhaps people could give me some pointers on (it has been a
couple of years  my Con Law class in college so I hope I am not
missing something obvious here...)

Basic Scenario:

	I set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of
	files on disk.  The general setup is designed so that when users 
	connect they send a private key encrypted using the system public
	key and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap the
	one-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  The
	result of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it
	is impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the
	machine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealed
	system private key to entice users into revealing thier personal
	private keys during the authentication sequence.

Questions:

	Does the fact that the system private key does not provide any
	information useful for a search give me any protection as far as
	 coerced to reveal the key?  (I doubt it myself..)

	It seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am
	assisting in "entrapment" (the users  send thier key anyway
	and are not  enticed into doing something they  not
	otherwise do) but is  any other hook that can be used?

	 the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval?

Any answers or general musings on the   be appreciated...

At first I was going to complain that your analogy was completely
irrelevant.  But then I remembered something.

Remember that move to get the U.S. to the metric system all 
years ago?  As far as I know we were supposed to be  by now.

The government sold it as better for the people, easier to be in
tune with the rest of the world.  They had decided it was for
our own good.

Then, when the plan was released, it soon became apparant that the
government were a bunch 'o' thickies.

 about it, change all the railroad track widths, signs,
screws, abolish the old regime.

At the cost of millions of dollars.

Your point is well taken.  You   is nothing to worry
about, you could care less who designs your cryptography, any
more than who designs your screws or the system of measurement
you use.

Sit back, that's right, just relax, we'll take care of all your
needs Mr. Molitor.

     In previous postings by Hellman, Bellovin, etal it was
reported the Big Brother () chip will encrypt plaintext in
64 bit blocks as is done with DES.  The users key K which can be
derived from RSA, Diffy-Hellman, etc. is used to encrypt
plaintext M and is then used to form a "three part message".
     This three part message consists of E[M; K], K encrypted
with some other key, and the chip serial number.  This three part
message is then encrypted by  another key.
     My question is: What is a message?
     For example, say we are dealing with an encrypted digitized
voice application.  The speech waveform is sampled and digitized
and then some number of samples are grouped into a 64 bit block.
This block is then encrypted and transmitted over a non-secure
communications link.
     Where is the three part message?  Is something appended to
each 64 bit block?  Is a header sent at the beginning of the
session?
     If the header is sent at the beginning of the session, how
do they insure the equipment manufacturer using the chip does
just that?  Can just anyone manufacture products using the chip?
Is a facility clearance required to manufacture?
     Any ideas?

I am sure you didn't miss the implication that we could have another
Richard Nixon type president in the future (perhaps not too distant
future, acutally).  With that in mind, then I take it you also 
not object to the Gov coming up with a decision (not proposal - just
like Clinton Cripple is a decision, not a proposal) sprung on us to
start placing video cameras with sound in every room of your house,
which could be activated without your knowlege.  They  be well
concealed so you n't know the location, to prevent you from covering
the lens opening.  After all, nothing you're doing  be of the
slightest interest to a government official, right?  So, you surely
 not object to such a proposal...

Not the best anology, but the principle is pretty close - the ability
to eavesdrop on your activity with little or no effort, without your
knowlege, protected by entirely by "government safeguards".  You can
 draw your curtains, so you can  have your privacy from everyone
else (except Big Brother)!!  After all we need this for protection from
drug dealers and terrorists and other criminals (like 'enemies of the
STATE')... and you   have a right to "unbreakable" privacy
anyway, sort of as the press release of the Clinton Cripple DECISION
puts it...

I find it curious they use the word "unbreakable" when the term 
 be "difficult to break without proper authorization" (which the
Government most certainly has at  disposal, right?  They n't
want to be able to break it ILLEGALLY,  they?)...  Nawww, not
"for the People" Clinton....

Can you,  my mind is on it, give us one good reason that the
algorithm  be a secret algorithm, unless this encryption scheme
either is a joke, or contains features like a 'master key' or other back
door for UNAUTHORIZED eavesdropping? If it was  even moderately
secure, and the government  meant to require the proper 
 and the keys that are in the  accounts to be able to decipher
the traffic, what is the need to keep the algorithm secret?  Seems I
hear rather often that if an encryption scheme requires the algorithm
to remain a secret to be effective, it is not a worth scheme... is
this just idle talk, or is the Administration bullshitting everyone?

With GREAT skepticism, and many doubts on our Administrations intentions...

And WAIT!! We haven't been told the NEXT gem the Administration has in
mind for e-mail and datafile security.  The press release does say that
this is part of a comprehensive thing on data security for us unprivileged
citizens.  Perhaps 's'  be the better term - 'citizens'
somehow does not seem appropriate... that implies a free people, 's'
better fits a population who serve at the pleasure of  rulers.
One thing for certain:  The government no longer regards the citizens
as  bosses anymore, but the other way around...

The point you all seem to have missed was covered when the UK cellphone
scrambling system was discussed.  Incidentally, my MP has responded to
my questions on that issue, and it appears that the UK and other `approved'
countries will get the secure A5 encryption, and `dodgy' countries will
get A5X.  Existing mobile equipment will drop to clear mode when used with
A5X systems, but newer equipment will use A5/A5X/clear depending on the
capabilities of the base station.

The cops/feds do *not* need to be able to get hold of your private key to
listen in to cellular conversations.  Encryption is not end-to-end, but 
cellphone to base-station - it *has* to be this way so that cellular users
and fixed installations can talk to each other.  For cellular to cellular
calls, the transmission is decrypted at the base-station, passed to another
base-station and re-encrypted.  The cops/feds can listen to the unscrambled
call *provided* they get a warrant to tap into the cellular provider's
equipment.  The only reason for wanting a crackable system is so they can
listen without having to obtain a warrant.

But, maybe the  system is secure, and they  do need a warrant
to get the key out of  before they can listen in using a scanner (see
above - they  *have* to go down this route anyway).  I have my doubts,
but even if true once they have the key they will *never* again need a
warrant to tap into that particular phone whenever they want.  `Well, Judge,
it appears he wasn't a drug-dealer after all, so naturally we'll stop
listening in'...

You have every reason to be scared shitless.  Take a look at the records
of McCarthy, Hoover (J. Edgar, not the cleaner - though they both excelled at
sucking) and Nixon.

   I suspect that this  thing could backfire on the Gov in a
big hurry. I expect that products using  chips will socket them
rather than soldering them,  once the keys are handed over by the
 agencies, the chip is so much garbage, and will need to be
replaced. I expect that someone will come along with a pin compatible
chip that uses secure encryption -- possibly even disguised so that it's
not possible to tell it from the  chip until you try to use the
2 backdoor keys.

   If I were to manufacture such a chip, as part of my marketing
strategy, I  try to subvert one or both  agencies either
through bribes or industrial espionage -- and then publicize the fact.
(doing my best not to be connected with such activities -- which 
likely not be legal :-) Publicly discrediting the  agencies 
go quite far towards creating a market for a secure alternative.

  I also believe that someone will reverse engineer the  chip,
and knowlege of the algorithm will likely be fairly widespread. Any back-
doors or weaknesses  further discredit the scheme, and help grow
the market demand for a secure alternative.

 I believe that the company that provides such an alternative will make
few friends in the LE community, but lots of money. I also believe that
the government will do it's best to make such plug replacements illegal.
I expect that they will see the same success in limiting the availability
of such alternatives as they have seen in limiting the availability of
certain illicit drugs -- ie. little to none.

Ian Ameline.

Just a question. 
As a provider of a public BBS service - aren't you bound by law to gurantee
intelligble access to the data of the users on the BBS, if police comes
with sufficent authorisation ? I guessed this  be  a basic condition
for such systems. (I did run a bbs some time ago, but that was in Switzerland)

Another objection occurred to me.   was a comment about how
supposedly   only be one decode box, operated by the FBI.
This is flat ridiculous, and I  believe it for a millisecond.
Even *if* they in fact only build one (or two or some other small
number) of , that won't stop others from building one.  Make
it work like two -chip phones, one listening to each side
of the recorded conversation.  I'll have to have another look at
the specs posted so far, but offhand I didn't see anything that
 preclude this sort of thing.....

How about this:  The
TelCo has your  key.  The TelCo
has your intended partner's key, if he is
using one.  Whenever you call, the message
gets decrypted and reencrypted wihtout
y key exchange.  I know it's a stupid
system, but for the feds, it'd be
great.  The point of this isn;t to
take over the crypto market, BTW.  Clinton
doen not want people to have any sort of crypto at
all (just like Busch).  But he needs some support
for the "technology initiative" garbage he's
pushing (industrial policy stuff) and a computer
hip designed by the gov't is just the thing.

Who's going to thing about the (literal) Billions of
Dollars it took for a government agency to design?

I feel like Winston Churchill in 1941 :( ...... but,
the privacy  will, TO THE EXTENT KEY  IS LEGITIMATE, stop
most of the abuse of wiretaps by local cops, company cops, angry husbands/

Proctor&Gamble cops, etc. to bypass even a product as flawed as the ClipJob.

Now I admit, I am hard pressed to find anything else good to say about it
except that, if it actually takes off, someone will certainly come up with
a REAL crypto chip (pin compatable!) that we can buy... Unless, of course,
Big Brother makes it illegal to have real crypto 'cause good honest law

That sounds like an old _Dragnet_ episode.

  "Joe and I went to the apartment of Prime Suspect.  Nobody answered the
  door, but his landlord gave us permission to search the apartment."

Perhaps that worked in California in the 60's, but as I understand the
law landlords do _not_ have authority to grant permission to search space
rented by a third party, provided the lease is not in default, etc.
(I'm not even sure if they can provide the master key, when shown a search
warrant,  the __ of the search is supposed to be notified).

At this point the question becomes: did the user "rent" the disk space
her encrypted file occupies?  If she did, it __ fall under the same
body of case law that applies to apartments, storage lockers, etc.  (As
to whether any   recognize this fact....)  If she did not (i.e.,
no compensation exchanged), I  know how it  be treated -- 
doesn't seem to be a non-cyberspace equivalent.

Unless  has been a _major_ change in the law, 's no such beast
as a "classified patent."  Patents exist to encourage communications and
develop the state of the art. 

(The 17-year lock is a nuisance, but historically has been pretty trivial.
It's only in an industry which doubles performance every three years (or
18 months, for some hardware) that 17 years is an eternity).

The same thing applies in civilian development: you can't patent something 
_and_ declare it a "trade secret."  However, you can (and ) mark all
software (including proprietary code) "unpublished copyright" so that it
ever does get exposed you  have some legal protection.

(Post-Berne this isn't required,  everything is "born copyrighted."
But it takes a  for people to learn the new rules).

The following document summarizes the  Chip, how it is used,
how programming of the chip is coupled to key generation and the
 process, and how law enforcement decrypts communications.
  has been some speculation on this news group about my
own involvement in this project, I'd like to add that I was not in
any way involved.  I found out about it when the FBI briefed me on
Thursday evening, April 15.   then I have spent considerable
time talking with the NSA and FBI to learn more about this, and I
attended the NIST briefing at the Department of Commerce on April 16.  
The document below is the result of that effort.

                     THE  CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY

                               Dorothy Denning

                                April 19, 1993


INTRODUCTION

On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring
together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program
to provide secure communications  meeting the legitimate needs of
law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption
chip called the " Chip" together with a split-key approach to
ing keys.  Two  agencies are used, and the key parts from
both are needed to reconstruct a key.


CHIP STRUCTURE

The  Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption
algorithm called "Skipjack."  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared
with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16
for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is
16 Mbits a second.

Each chip includes the following components:

   the Skipjack encryption algorithm
   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips
   N, a 30-bit serial number
   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip


ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP

To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T
telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and
we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure
conversation, my security device will negotiate a session key K with
the device at the other end (in general, any method of key exchange can
be used).  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then
fed into the  Chip to produce two values:

   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and 
   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.  

The law enforcement block thus contains the session key K encrypted
under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all
encrypted under the family key F.


CHIP PROGRAMMING AND 

All  Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (secure computer
information facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains
a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips
are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at
Mikotronx.

At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key
 agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters an 80-bit value S1
into the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value S2.  values
serve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers.

To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is
first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.
S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a
64-bit block R1:

        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .

Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and
N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  

        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] 
        R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .

R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The
first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The
rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2
are the key parts that are separately ed with the two 
agencies.

As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are
written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a
file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part
U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third
disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent
2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.
After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the
vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional
assurance that no information is left behind.
 
The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the
room instead of two.  The first two  provide the seeds S1 and S2,
and the second two (the  agents)  take the disks back to
the  agencies.

The  agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not
be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or
both may be independent from the government.


LAW ENFORCEMENT USE

When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they
will first take the warrant to the service provider in  to get
access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in
place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with
.  They will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the
family key F.  This gives them E[K; U] + N.  They will then take a
warrant identifying the chip serial number N to each of the key 
agents and get back U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce
the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K.
Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished
through a special black box decoder operated by the FBI.


ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND  NOTICE.  All information is based on
information provided by NSA, NIST, and the FBI.  Permission to
distribute this document is granted.

I   that you could reduce the defense of using non-
based encryption technologies to defending freedom of expression 
(IE, free speech).  That you have to right to express whatever you
want in whatever form your little heart desires so long as you do
not impinge on the rights of others.

Encrypted text/sound/video is just another form of expression of that
particular text/sound/video.  Just like digitized sound is another 
 of expression of sound -- streams of 100100101111 instead of
continuous waveforms.

Also, it n't be up to the government at all.  Encryption 
_Standards_ can be decided upon by Independent Standards Orgainizations
(apologies for the acronym).  One can note how well this has worked
with ISO and the Metric System, SAE, etc.  Independent entities 
or consortia of people/industries in that particular area are far
more qualified to set standards than any One government agency.
Consider for example what the Ascii character set  have looked
like if it was decided by the government.

I hope this helps folks to formulate  defenses.  I'm  working
on mine and hope to be faxing my congressmen soon...

Here are two quotes from the White House.

``The Administration is not saying, " encryption threatens the
public safety and effective law enforcement, we will prohibit it
outright" (as some countries have effectively done); nor is the U.S.
saying that "every American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
unbreakable commercial encryption product."''

``In making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the private
sector from developing, or the government from approving, other
microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in assuring
both privacy and a secure key- system.''

 quotes bother me in three ways. (1) Many people will read and
remember that ``encryption threatens the public safety and effective
law enforcement.'' (2) The Administration is explicitly failing to
acknowledge that every American is entitled to use strong encryption
to ensure his own privacy. (3) The President, by implication, may
intend to outlaw any cryptographic devices which ensure privacy but
do not have a key- system.

I want to see an  which will combat such statements.
Encryption does _not_ threaten the public safety, any more than ski
masks do. Every American _is_ entitled to use strong encryption which
ensures his own privacy and is _not_ crippled by a key- system.
I guess I'm looking for a ``League for Cryptographic Freedom.'' Or a
``National Cryptography Association.''

To what extent does the EFF serve this purpose? Is a new 
necessary? Does it already exist?

 might be a good way to cover the use of another layer of
encryption.

Currently, when you send an encrypted message, an opponent can usually
tell 1) that you are using encryption 2) which encryption method you
are using [because that information is usually in the clear].

With , most opponents will only know that you are sending
-text, they won't know that your -text is itself
encoded.

Only  few opponents who get your -keys will know
that your message is double encrypted.

... kind of like a safety deposit box containing a lock box.

So,  just  of replacements for , also  of front

Even if what Brad says turns out to be accurate, you can bet that the
Administration will have made it "very clear" to the vendors that "it
 very much be in  best interests" to institute a "voluntary"
policy of using to sell anything but Clinton Cripple equipped equipment
to anyone other than "Authorized government agencies and Law Enforcement",
or individuals and corporations who "have been been determined by the
Administration to have a valid need on a case-by-case basis" for an
effective system.

Note that this is very much like the language used in many gun control
bills/laws the Administration is pushing for, or otherwise supporting.
The logic and actual rationale (as opposed to the excuses that get fed
to the media) is the same in both cases, only the items or technology
in question are different.

I  this is no accident.  It comes from the same philosophy that
the government rules/controls the people, not the people controlling
the government, that the unconnected citizens are not sophisticated enough
to know what is best for them, so the government must tell the people
what they need or do not need ... "we know best...".  And the idea that
that a commoner can defend himself against government eavesdropping
or unlawful attack is totally unacceptable to people with this outlook.

>
>Hal Finney

Combine this all with pushing for national identity cards with 'smart
chips' to encode anything they please (internal passport) under the
guise of streamlining the State People's Health Care System, and with
(you can be certain) more jewels yet to come, and one sees an extremely
ominous trend.  So what if "1984" will be ten years late... it  is
turning out to be an amazingly accurate prophecy... unless a LOT of
people wake up, and in a hurry.

One  ALWAYS have every red warning light and bell and danger flag
come up when the government seeks to set itself apart in regard to
rights, etc.  from the unconnected/unprivileged citizen (or  we
now be saying '' instead?)...  Why N'T the average person
have a good, secure system of data security, not dependent on nebulous
'safeguards' for maintaining that security?  Why N'T the average
person be able to defend himself from an agency gone rogue?  0I am sure
the Feds could break into any data they  wanted to (but it 
take some WORK), and using the same logic, one  not be allowed to
have a good safe, unless a duplicate of the key(s) or combination are
submitted for 'safekeeping' by the government?  I   see a
difference, philosophically.  Encrypted data sure won't evaporate, not
with such high-tech tools as a TAPE REC...

Ok, so  are in fact two distinct components transmitted by the
chip; the real message encrypted with the "conventional" key, and the
serial number and encrypted "conventional" key encrypted with the
(IMHO kind of bogus, as the whole concept of "one key that millions of
people use which can't be changed" doesn't seem reasonable) "family
key".

Suppose I analyze the output of this chip and I'm able to determine
which bits are the encrypted packet which contains the serial number
and session key.  Suppose I also design a simple algorithm based on
this information which takes the data containing the encrypted session
key and twiddles a bit (or several) before it's sent down the line.

Mind you, I'm sure the NSA thought of this along with a dozen other
attacks I can't imagine, and the system is probably somehow designed
so that manipulation of this information will cause a compliant
receiving chip to somehow fail to decrypt successfully.  But how?
What if the two parties agree in advance on some kind of consistent
bit-twiddling scheme, so the decryption chip sees the restored
"proper" bitstream but an eavesdropper gets a E[K; UK] packet that's
wrong?

I suppose this could be easily defeated if the chip "sends" that
information out many times in slightly different ways, making it
effectively impossible to be certain you know all the information
 sent.

Here is a disturbing thought.

Now, we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets. We live in
the electronic age. I asked myself, how big could the  database
get? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were
I an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the 
houses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)

Well, lets see. Ten bytes of each  half. Lets asume ten bytes of
serial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but
this is an  of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as the
population, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for
each of the two  databases. Fits conveniently on a single very
valuable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who
cares -- I can already hold all the  keys in the country in my
pocket on two 8mm tapes.

Admittely, they will  of safeguards. They won't put the whole
database on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks
in the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day
by hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience
will dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At
some point, with or without collusion by the agencies,  exabyte
tapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and  Sternlight will
doubtless claim this can't happen -- but we know that "can't" is a
prayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.

With two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you  hold the keys for
every person's conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, you
need the "master key" two -- but thats just ten bytes of information
that have to be stored an awful lot of places.

Come to  of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the database
isn't a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial
political views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, the
ones that  Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the
evil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have
a big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial
secrets, so he isn't  completely irrational here (although why
our companies couldn't use cryptosystems without back doors is left
unexplained by  that point out this threat.) 

Presumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA
and other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened
many times. Presumably, someday they will get  hands on some
fraction of the keys. You can't avoid that sort of thing.

 pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get  hands on
the  databases.

We crypto types are all taught something very important at the
beginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the
easily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on a
secret. The  databases aren't the sorts of secrets that our
teachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they
 lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million
 chips.

I cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this
doesn't realize all this already. They are too smart.  are too
many of them who have made  bones in the real world. I suspect
that they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they are
doing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue
to surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspect
that they realize that they can't put things off forever, but they can
try to delay things as long as possible.

Who knows. Maybe even some of the higher ups, the inevitable
bureaucratic types that rise in any ,  do believe
that this scheme might give people some security, even as 
subordinates in Fort Meade wring  hands over the foolishness of
it all.

The Supreme  seems to disagree with you -- they have stated that
"the people" is a term of art ering to an individual right, and
have explicitly mentioned the second amendment as an example.

I quote:

  "... 'the people' seems to have been a term of art employed in
  select parts of the Constitution.  The Preamble declares that the
  Constitution is ordained, and established by 'the people of the
  the U.S.'  The Second Amendment protects the right of the people
  to keep and bear Arms ...."
	- Supreme  of the U.S.,  U.S. v. Uerdugo-Uriquidez (1990).

Furthermore, in the Miller decision, they only permitted prosecution
for possession of a sawed-off shotgun because the defense had not
presented testimony and they theore accepted the argument of the
government that such weapons have no military value -- they held that
the amendment protected the individual right to possess military
weapons. Unfortunately, no second amendment case has successfully
gotten to the  in fifty years. However, that does not change the
interpretation.

Furthermore, it appears that others disagree with you as well, vis:

 "The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept,
  and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the
  United States, as well as its interpretation by every major
  commentator and  in the first half-century after its ratifi-
  cation, indicates that what is protected is an individual right
  of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner."
   - Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the
     Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate,
     97th Congress, Second Session ( February 1982 )

You might rightfully ask "well then, what does that first bit about
militias mean?"

Well, "militia" in historical context basically  the whole of the
adult males of the country. (Indeed, the U.S. Code  defines
"militia" as all armed men over the age of 17).

   "The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting
    in concert for the common defense ....  And ...  men were
    expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of
    the kind in common use at the time."
	- Supreme  of the United States,  U.S. v. Miller (1939).

The reason for the phrase   was to explain the rationale
behind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people to
bear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of military
power could ever occur which  permit tyranny -- in short, the
government  remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather than
the other way around.

   "No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.  The strongest reason
   for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last
   resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government."
     - Thomas Jefferson, Proposal Virginia Constitution, June 1776
       1 Thomas Jefferson Papers, 334 (C. J. Boyd, Ed., 1950).

   "And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not
   warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of
   resistance ?  Let them take arms ... The tree of liberty must be
   reshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants."
     - Thomas Jefferson (letter to William S. Smith, 1787, in
       Jefferson, On Democracy 20, S. Padover, ed., 1939).

   "Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed;
   as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe.  The supreme
   power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword;
   because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute
   a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on
   any pretense, raised in the United States."
     - Noah Webster, "An Examination into the Leading Principles
       of the Federal Constitution" (1787), in Pamphlets on the
       Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).

You may disagree with the second amendment, and wish that it be
repealed, but please do not pretend that it isn't  and that it
doesn't mean what it says. You might argue that conditions have
changed and that it  no longer be present, but you can't imagine
it away.

I could fill a book with detailed argumentation. Many have already.

However, none of this has anything to do with cryptography.  Lets get
it out of here. If you insist on discussing this, please do it in
talk.politics.guns, where people will gladly discuss this matter with
you.

And the initiative for actual implementation.  Clinton is not just an
innocent bystander here - They didn't just slap his name on it without
consulting him.  What exactly is his extensive history of individual
rights advocacy that people are assuming he  has nothing to do
with this?  He just went back on his pledge to cut the espionage
budget, and is now asking for more money than even Bush wanted.

Ironically, the domino theory in fact *was* a reasonable metaphor for

the Wall later that year....and then to the ultimate collapse of the

e.g. on an RS/6000 (AIX 3.2) you can get lots of relatively

Doesn't this just mean that the government might not approve
something for use by other government agencies.  This does not
sound to me to be any form of threat that Joe User can't develop
and use his own encryption algorithm.

If the  chip can do cheap crypto for the masses, obviously one
could do the same thing WITHOUT building in back doors.

Indeed, even without special engineering, you can construct a good
system right now. A standard codec chip, a chip to do vocoding, a DES
chip, a V32bis integrated modem module, and a small processor to do
glue work, are all you need to have a secure phone. You can dump one
or more of the above if you have a fast processor. With integration,
you could put all of them onto a single chip -- and in the future they
can be.

Yes, cheap crypto is good -- but we  need it from the government.
You can do everything the  chip can do without needing it to be
compromised. When the White House releases stuff saying "this is good
because it gives people privacy", note that we didn't need them to
give us privacy, the capability is available using commercial hardware
right now.

Indeed, were it not for the government doing everything possible to
stop them, Qualcomm  have designed strong encryption right in to
the CDMA cellular phone system they are pioneering. Were it not for
the NSA and company, cheap encryption systems  be everywhere. As
it is, they try every trick in the book to stop it. Had it not been
for them, I'm sure cheap secure phones  be out right now.

They aren't the ones making cheap crypto available. They are the ones
keeping cheap crypto out of people's hands. When they hand you a
 chip, what you are getting is a mess of pottage -- your prize
for having traded in your birthright.

And what did we buy with our birthright? Did we get safety from
foreigners? No. They can read conference papers as well as anyone else
and are using strong cryptography. Did we get safety from professional
terrorists? I suspect that they can get cryptosystems themselves on
the open market that work just fine -- most of them can't be idiots
like the guys that bombed the trade center. Are we getting cheaper
crypto for ourselves? No, because the market  have provided that
on its own had they not deliberately sabotaged it.

Someone please tell me what exactly we get in our social contract in
exchange for giving up our right to strong cryptography?

True, but will traditional encryptions schemes, when further encrypted

Here are two quotes from the White House.

``The Administration is not saying, " encryption threatens the
public safety and effective law enforcement, we will prohibit it
outright" (as some countries have effectively done); nor is the U.S.
saying that "every American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
unbreakable commercial encryption product."''

``In making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the private
sector from developing, or the government from approving, other
microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in assuring
both privacy and a secure key- system.''

 quotes bother me in three ways. (1) Many people will read and
remember that ``encryption threatens the public safety and effective
law enforcement.'' (2) The Administration is explicitly failing to
acknowledge that every American is entitled to use strong encryption
to ensure his own privacy. (3) The President, by implication, may
intend to outlaw any cryptographic devices which ensure privacy but
do not have a key- system.

I want to see an  which will combat such statements.
Encryption does _not_ threaten the public safety, any more than ski
masks do. Every American _is_ entitled to use strong encryption which
ensures his own privacy and is _not_ crippled by a key- system.
I guess I'm looking for a ``League for Cryptographic Freedom.'' Or a
``National Cryptography Association.''

To what extent does the EFF serve this purpose? Is a new 
necessary? Does it already exist?

``In making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the private
sector from developing, or the government from approving, other
microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in assuring
both privacy and a secure key- system.''

 quotes bother me in three ways. (1) Many people will read and
remember that ``encryption threatens the public safety and effective
law enforcement.'' (2) The Administration is explicitly failing to
acknowledge that every American is entitled to use strong encryption
to ensure his own privacy. (3) The President, by implication, may
intend to outlaw any cryptographic devices which ensure privacy but
do not have a key- system.

I want to see an  which will combat such statements.
Encryption does _not_ threaten the public safety, any more than ski
masks do. Every American _is_ entitled to use strong encryption which
ensures his own privacy and is _not_ crippled by a key- system.
I guess I'm looking for a ``League for Cryptographic Freedom.'' Or a
``National Cryptography Association.''

To what extent does the EFF serve this purpose? Is a new 
necessary? Does it already exist?

All the chips need replacing. It angers people, undermines confidence

The chip and algorithm are classified.  If you reverse engineer it and

Perhaps some foreign governments or corporations could help us out by
cracking the system outside the USA.  The US government could probably
stop importation of clone hardware, but a software implementation
 be practical.

 the AT&T wiretap chip is scheduled to be distributed 
internationally, allowing the U.S. government to spy on foreign 
governments, companies and people as as well as to wiretap domestic 
citizens, this is a world-wide issue.  Thus : world.

ygoland@wright.seas.ucla.edu (The Jester) :

>However assuming that I can  encrypt things as I please, who

Why do we hackers care about the  chip?  Do we give a shit
about anybody's privacy accept our own?  And perhaps not even our
own; are we so smart that we always know when we're talking to
somebody who has a wiretap on  phone?

I find the "call thru your computer" ideas may lect this attitude.
Ideas that are of, by, and for hackers, and  help anybody in the
real world, aren't going to do anybody much good, including ourselves
where voice phones are concerned.

We *do* need an alternative to NSA-bugged telephones, but
we're talking inexpensive *telephones* here, including hand-sized
cellulars, that need strong crypto, real privacy.  Make-shift
computer hacker rigs that require living by your computer to
talk privately over the phone are just a dumb stunt that doesn't 
do anything for anybody's privacy in the real world.  

What we need is a true *privacy chip*.  For example, a real-time 
voice-encryption RSA, silicon compile it and spit out ASIC.  
Put this chip on the market as a de facto standard for international 
business, diplomats, and private communications.  If the U.S. bans 
it, we make it somewhere else and import it.  The Japanese, German,
Dutch, Taiwanese, Korean, etc. electronics companies  want the 
NSA spying on them.  U.S. workers lose more jobs to government fascist
stupidity.

  Simple -- if you have a choice between:

 1. American manufacturers peddling Cripple Chips with a secret untested
     algorithm whose keys are held by people with a history of untrustworthy
     behavoir, or

 2. Japanese (to pick the obvious example) manufacturers peddling encryption
     chips with an algorithm that has faced public scrutiny and keys under
     the control of the user,

which  you choose?  At most, the American government can deny this
choice to American citizens (and probably not that, if the glorious success
of the War on Drugs is any example); it can't do much about the global market.

denning@guvax.acc.georgetown.edu (Vidkun Abraham Lauritz Quisling) :

   Each chip includes the following components:

      the Skipjack encryption algorithm
      F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips
      N, a 30-bit serial number
      U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip

Hmmm. A thirty bit serial number. And, we are told, the unit key U is
derived deterministically from this serial number. That  that
 are only one billion possible unit keys.

   To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is
   first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.
   S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a
   64-bit block R1:

	   R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .

   Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and
   N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  

	   R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] 
	   R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .

   R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The
   first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The
   rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2
   are the key parts that are separately ed with the two 
   agencies.

Hmmm. We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serial
number N rather than generating it from a randomly selected U1 and U2
is an intentional way of assuring a "fail safe" for the government --
U is completedly determined given S1, S2 and N. If S1 and S2 do not
change they constitute effective "master keys" (along with F), the
theft of which (or the possession of which by various authorities)
completely obviates the security of the system. However, more
interestingly, we know, for a fact that if S1 and S2 are fixed no
matter what the keyspace for U is no more than 2^30. Why not pick U1
and U2 at random? Why this interesting restriction of they key space
if it NOT to provide an additional back door?

I find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant on
approximately 30 bytes worth of information that could be written on
the back of a napkin.

Even if S1 and S2 change periodically, the rationale behind this
restriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one is
assuming that the goal is security -- and makes perfect sense if the
goal is an illusion of security.

If S1 and S2 do not change, even if they remain secret I wonder if
they can somehow be back-derived given enough unit key/serial number
pairs. We are assured that this cannot happen -- but no one
understands how Skipjack works outside of government officials and,
soon, foreign intelligence services that gain the information via
espionage. Presumably we will eventually have the information as well
-- reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year -- but
by the time we know it may be too late.

   As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are
   written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a
   file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part
   U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third
   disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent
   2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.
   After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the
   vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional
   assurance that no information is left behind.

None of this makes me feel the least bit secure. The silly notion of
"destroying the laptop" appears to be yet another bizarre distraction.
We all know that you can't read data from DRAM that has been turned
off for more than a few moments. On the other hand, what we  know
is why  is a need to generate the unit keys from S1 and S2 in the
first place other than to weaken the system. We  know if the
agents in question  resist a million in cash a piece for 
information -- its probably worth hundreds of million, so you can make
the bribe arbitrarily hard to resist. And to tell you the truth, doing
this in a "vault" rather than in Joe Random Tempest-shielded Room
with a laptop computer seems like melodrama designed to make
high-school dropouts from Peoria impressed -- but it does very little
for most of the rest of us.

   The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the
   room instead of two.  The first two  provide the seeds S1 and S2,
   and the second two (the  agents)  take the disks back to
   the  agencies.

What  this provide? Lets say the  agencies are the ACLU and
the NRA and  agents personally take back the disks and are always
honest. Who cares? The NSA must be laughing out loud, because they
have the algorithm to regenerate U given N and likely  need to
steal they keys as they effectively already have them.

Oh, but can Big Brother afford such things in  times of tight
budgets?

I  know how many folks noticed it, but Dorothy "Trust Me" Denning gave
a real clue to the current state of the art at NSA on decrypto machines when
she said the NSA told her they didn't even want to be the holder of any
part of the key.  

Now why is that?  I doubt  is a trapdoor in Skipjack.  (But we will
never know).  And I doubt the NSA  promote a mass market chip they
couldn't compromise.  Ergo, NSA is now capable of compromising (probably
with brute force keysearch) engines of the complexity of Skipjack.  Look
at the specs.  Why, I bet they have thousands of little chips chugging
away in  crypto busters... Maybe even tens of thousands.  Complexity?
Not much more than a 3090.  How many such machines will fit into Fort Meade?

I'm  not entirely sure I trust EFF any more to be honest.

Anyway, any organisation can be deeply infiltrated.  Look at CND in Britain
a dozen years ago - one of  top members was an SIS spy who stole 
complete address list.  How hard  it be to get one person to sneak in
and copy the  data to disk?

They  have to track customer lists - they merely have to digitally
listen to any phone line and eliminate any that  have the 
header/signature.  (No-one has said how it will be modulated - want a bet
it's a non-standard and hence easily recognisable baudrate?)

Devices to scan exchanges and detect modems etc already exist.  I've seen
them advertised in the trade press.

Once you eliminate crippled crypto devices and ordinary data modems, what's
left is crypto worth looking more closely at.  I guess any substitute scheme
will have to be v32bis or v.fast to disguise it, though then they just start
looking at the data too...

Whatever happens though, the effect of this new chip will be to make private
crypto stand out like a sore thumb.

Hmm, here are a couple:

1) If the algorithm becomes known, it will be easy to produce
pin-compatible non-crippled chips that provide -real- encryption and
privacy, because  keys are only in  users' hands.

2)  SkipJack is a symmetric key cypher, it needs some way to
agree on a session key. The released information says that any
protocol may be used (e.g., DH). From a theoretical point of view,
this is probably true. However, from a practical point of view, 
chips must have some kind of key exchange protocol built-in. What if
it is good old RSA? This will mean that the producer will have to pay
lots of bucks to PKP. By keeping the details secret this can be
avoided...

      Just a question. 
      As a provider of a public BBS service - aren't you bound by law to gurantee
      intelligble access to the data of the users on the BBS, if police comes
      with sufficent authorisation ? I guessed this  be  a basic condition
      for such systems. (I did run a bbs some time ago, but that was in Switzerland)

The US doesn't yet have many laws covering BBSs - they're not common carriers,
they're not phone companies, they're just private machines or services
operated by businesses.  's no obligation to keep records.
As Perry Metzger points out, if the police come with a search warrant,
you have to let them see what the warrant demands, if it exists,
and they generally can confiscate the equipment as "evidence"
(which is not Constitutionally valid, but we're only beginning to
develop  cases supporting us).  A  MAY be able to compel
you to tell them information you know, such as the encryption password
for the disk -  aren't any definitive cases yet,  it's a new
situation, and  probably aren't laws specifically covering it.
But the  can't force you to *know* the keys, and  are no
laws preventing you from allowing your users to have  own keys
for  own files without giving them to you.

Even in areas that do have established law,  is uncertainty.
 was a guy in Idaho a few years ago who had his business records
subpoenaed as evidence for taxes or some other business-restriction law,
so he gave the  the records.  Which were in Hebrew.
The US doesn't have laws forcing you to keep your records in English,
and  were the originals of the records.  HE didn't speak Hebrew,
and neither did anybody in the  .    they
were able to do much about it.

It might be illegal for your BBS to deny access to potential customers
based on race, religion, national origin, gender, or sexual perence;
it probably hasn't been tested in , but it seems like a plausible
extension of anti-discrimination laws affecting other businesses.

[Apologies for not posting to alt., or whatever, but it seems it
may not be in the newsfeed here.]

 may be another reason (good from NSA's point of view, horrible
from everyone else's) why the algorithm/chip design might be secret.

First, note that the "experts" will only look at "details", and of just 
the algorithm:

    In addition, respected experts from outside the
    government will be offered access to the confidential details of
    the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
     findings.

Why not the chip design?  Well, here's the possiblity:  in addition to
encryption, the chip pre-processes voice signals to make them easier
to analyze/transcribe electronically.  The chip, once widespread, might
effectively be part of a massively parallel computer for "voice-
grepping" the US phone network (or the criminal & wrong-ing patrons
of).

I n't put it past the NSA.   how much easier it  make life
for them.

And if this is indeed the case,  of the possible public outcry 
it become widely known.  Thus the secrecy.

It might be a good idea to have experts in DSP, voice recognition, and
AI conversation-understanding to be on that panel, and insist they be
given (authenticatable) design specs and implementation documentation.

Perhaps the trusted  agencies can be the ones who come up with
S1 and S2, and if  agencies are  trusted (ACLU & NRA is an
interesting example), we can hope that they'll use some physical
process to come up with truly random numbers. If the NSA comes up with
the numbers, that's a trap door you could drive a truck through.

Me either.

   It seems from the following that the CPSR is atleats starting to
question this bogosity:

    ----------------------------------------------------------------
April 16, 1993
Washington, DC

               COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS CALL FOR PUBLIC
           DEBATE ON NEW GOVERNMENT ENCRYPTION INITIATIVE

        Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR)
today called for the public disclosure of technical data
underlying the government's newly-announced "Public Encryption
Management" initiative.  The new cryptography scheme was
announced today by the White House and the National Institute
for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the
technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman
acknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super-
secret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the
encryption technology around which the new initiative is built.

        According to NIST, the technical specifications and the
Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To
open the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today
filed a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests
with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security
Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption
plan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the
Computer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in  to
open the development of non-military computer security standards
to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of
such standards.

        CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in
developing the so-called "digital signature standard" (DSS), a
communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for
government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA
lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first
time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard.
NSA is due to file papers in federal  next week justifying
the classification of records concerning its creation of the
DSS.

         Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the
administration's apparent commitment to the privacy of
electronic communications, as lected in today's official
statement,  "a step in the right direction."  But he questioned
the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent
secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from
public scrutiny.  "At a time when we are moving towards the
development of a new information infrastructure, it is vital
that standards designed to protect personal privacy be
established openly and with full public participation.  It is
not appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of
secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to
play a leading role in the development process."

        CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer
industry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of
technology on society.   CPSR has 21 chapters in the U.S. and
maintains offices in Palo Alto, California, Cambridge,
Massachusetts and Washington, DC.  For additional information on
CPSR, call (415) 322-3778 or e-mail <cpsr@csli.stanford.edu>.

 So in a few years  could be millions of  chips in the USA, all
networked together? Sounds like a good science fiction story - the government
wants to crack foreign DES (or whatever) messages, so they con the public into
individually buying all of the components and installing them. Soon the US
could be covered by the largest parallel computer in the world, built on top of
our current phone net.

Summary: C functions to do arbitrary-precision arith
X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]

This is the file BIGNUMS.TXT from .msu.edu, last updated April 1993.

In response to Email requests, I have assembled this list of
large-integer arithmetic packages of which I have heard.
Most of  are C function libraries, available in source form.

For your convenience, I have placed copies of
some of  on .msu.edu (35.8.1.178).  They are
available for anonymous FTP in the directory "pub/bignum".
However, what I have may not be the most current version in all cases.

Here they are, in no particular :

mp
    Multiple Precision package that comes with some Unixes
    
    Multiple precision package accessed via -lmp flag on your
    compiler.  Provides +, -, *, /, gcd, exponentiation,
    sqrt.  Comes with SunOS, NeXT Mach, BBN Mach 1000, 
    and probably a few others.  See "man mp".  
    Object code only, of course.

PARI
    Henri Cohen, et al., Universite Bordeaux I, Paris, FRANCE
    
    Multiple precision desk calculator and library routines.
    Contains optimized assembly code for Motorola 68020, 
    semi-optimized code for SPARC, and apparently rather slow
    generic C version.  Does both integers and reals.
    Does vectors and matrices as well as scalars.
    Contains a number of advanced functions, some of which I've
    never heard of.  ("Weber's function"?)
    Has a factorization function, primality test, & other related stuff.
    Plenty of TEX documentation.
    Public domain, but you can't distribute modified versions.
    Available via anonymous FTP from math.ucla.edu.   seem to
    be Mac- and NeXT-specific versions  in addition to:
    Filename:  pari-1.35a.tar.Z
    
Arithmetic in Global Fields  (Arith)
    Kevin R. Coombes,  R. Grant
    
    Package of routines for arbitrary precision integers or
    polynomials over finite fields.  Includes basic +, -, *, /
    and a few others like gcd.  Source code in C.
    Distributed under the terms of the GNU public license.
    Includes man pages and TEX documentation.
    Filename:  arith.tar.Z

Arbitrary Precision Math Library
    Lloyd Zusman   Los Gatos, CA
    
    C package which supports basic +, -, *, /.  Provides for radix
    points (i.e., non-integers).  Not as polished as the others here.
    Posted to comp.sources.misc in October 1988.
    Filename:  apml.tar.Z
    
BigNum
    J. Vuillemin, INRIA, FRANCE, and others.
    Distributed by Digital Equipment Paris Research Lab (DECPRL)
    
    A "portable and efficient arbitrary-precision integer" package.
    C code, with generic C "kernel", plus assembly "kernels" for
    MC680x0, Intel i960, MIPS, NS32032, Pyramid, and of course VAX.
    This is probably one of the better-known packages of this type.
    Implements +, -, *, /, mod, plus logical operations OR, AND, XOR.
    Both signed and unsigned arithmetic available.
    Available via email from librarian@decprl.dec.com.
    You will receive 5 shell archives.  Give your postal address
    and you will also receive printed documentation from France.
    Package includes TEX documentation.
    Publicly available for non-commercial use.
    I removed this from my archive when I heard a rumor that PRL
    doesn't like others to distribute it.  However, BIGNUM *is*
    distributed as part of ecpp (see below).

Lenstra's package
    Arjen Lenstra   Bellcore
    
    Portable unsigned integer package written entirely in C.
    Includes +, -, *, /, exponentiation, mod, primality testing,
    sqrt, random number generator, and a few others.  The package
    was uncommented and undocumented; I have tried to add enough
    comments to get by.  This is the only of  packages that I
    have actually used.  It works well and is very portable.  
    I haven't done any benchmarks against the others, but the code 
    looks clever & Lenstra is an accomplished number theorist.
    Unlike the other packages here, this one requires you to allocate
    storage statically--only a problem if your numbers are  huge.
    Arjen has placed the code in the public domain.  
    Filename:  lenstra.tar.Z

lenstra_3.1
    Arjen Lenstra,  Bellcore

    An improved version of Arjen's package above.  This one
    does signed arithmetic and dynamic allocation (which can be turned
    off as an option). Has a few new routines, too.  "lenstra_3.1" contains
    minor bugfixes to the previously-available "lenstra_2" and "lenstra_3".
    Filename:  lenstra_3.1.c

bmp  (Brent's Multiple Precision?)
    R. P. Brent

    1981 vintage FORTRAN code to do extended precision floating &
    fixed point arithmetic.  Includes most of the mathematical
    functions you'd find in a FORTRAN run-time library.
    This code is an ACM algorithm, number 524.

SPX
    Kannan Alagappan & Joseph Tardo, DEC
    
    This is a huge prototype public key authentication system
    based on RSA.  I mention it here because  who have heard
    of SPX have probably correctly guessed that it contains a large
    integer package and I want to inform you that the large integer
    package it contains is indeed DEC's BigNum from France.
    You can get a beta test copy of SPX from crl.dec.com (192.58.206.2). 
    Use it only for testing, as it "may" expire on a certain date.
    (I  know whether this has expired yet.)

If you've got a secure device, you  need public keys.

If the secret key which all chips share is SK, you can just use KP =

Maybe that's why Jim Bidzos was reported as  cheesed off.

I seriously doubt that any practical implementation of this proposal 
place the onus on the individual to register keys.  Realistically, the
-Chip will probably emit an ID code which will serve as the identifier
when requesting the key fragments.  The chip manufacturer  register
this identifier code vs. key combination when the chip is made and the
(uninitiated) end-user can theore remain completely outside the loop.
The chip could be used in a cellular phone, a modem, or other device --
it  makes no difference:  When the authorities detect the use of this
encryption standard during surveillance, they  then capture the ID
and apply for the key in  to decrypt the data.

Please note that Bill Clinton probably has little if anything to do
with the design, implementation or reasoning behind this chip or behind
any "moves"  made using this chip as a pawn.

Remember, when you elect a president of the united states, it's not
the case that all the Republicans, etc. in the NSA and FBI and CIA
immediately pack  bags and get replaced by a team of fresh young
Democrats.  Most of the government -- say, 96% -- is appointed or
hired rather than elected.   this  device has been in

Secrecy in  Chip

The serial number of the  chip is encrypted with the system key and
transmitted as one part of a three part message.

Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential
analysis).

Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the  chip
and its communications channel.  The purpose of this chip is twofold:
    
	1) Transmit Channel

	    The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with
	    a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number
	    unrecoverable with just the system key

	2) Recieve Channel

	    The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number
	    with a secondary keying variable (assuming the serial number
	    is necessary for local operation).

This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  This gets more
interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large,
making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and
a spoofed serial number.  Without knowing the system key, you could
lie about the serial number, but risk detection of the lie.

IF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could
successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the
format of your own serial number.

Makes you wonder whats  hidden here?   Seems  like the secrecy is
to prevent you from lying about who you are.

 anything made in the US that has 128 bit keys?  Anything anywhere
that has larger keys?  I've heard that RC2 can be scaled to arbitrarily
large keys, but is this actually implemented anywhere?

Finally, can anyone even concieve of a time/place where 128 bit keys aren't
sufficient?  (I certainly can't - even at a trillion keys a second, it
 take about 10 billion years to search just one billionth of that keys
space.)

I agree.  So why is Cylink the only (and expensive) game in town?

Note: I  Cylink is great, and if my boss  double my salary, I'd buy 
a bunch of  stuff :).

One thing that  offers is interoperability, at a higher degree of 
security than we currently have in non-proprietary voice encryption systems.
This  it will be cheaper than anyone's proprietary scheme, and easier to 
deploy.  This is, of course, either a bug or a feature depending on how you

Great!  Where can I buy it?

You can build them right now as long as you  want to export (a 
restriction I firmly oppose).  The only thing stopping people from making 
cheap encryption is greed: they want a lock on the market.

Oh, come on.  Only if you trust it farther than it deserves.  A  phone

If  comes to cellular phones along with legal proscriptions against
using other cipher systems on  phones, a new and potentially dangerous
class of crime is created.

Criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications (specifically
the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key  cite as threats)
will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user, and
to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the
device will be delayed.

Once a suitable collection of devices is stolen, criminals can communicate
with impunity (assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from
key ) until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other .

Because life-is-cheap criminals are currently willing to kill people to steal
very large and conspicuous property (luxury cars), it is reasonable to assume
that they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuous
property (a cipher cellular phone).  Just as we have seen in the past with
"blue box" technology, and in the present with modified cellular phones,
we can expect to see among high-stakes criminals a lucrative market for
stolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days.  The high-stakes
criminals will pay the life-is-cheap types substantial amounts for stolen
instruments.

Because a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days,
a stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days.   will be a
continuing demand for fresh phones: fresh bodies.

In other words,  and similar systems have the potential to turn a
current inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct, vicious, and
persistent threat to the general public.

On the other hand, if a criminal were to apply some arbitrary cipher to a
device in a mostly non-ciphered network, the communication will at least
stand out as  unusual, and perhaps worthy of other  of investigation.

Finally, because  is essentially no possibility of intercepting in
realtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments,
 will exist strong motivation to record and archive _all_ communications
in the network for ex-post-facto scrutiny (once some criminal act is discovered,
and the instruments involved have been identified).   recording and
archiving may not be feasible for wireline networks, it is probably feasible
across the more limited bandwidth of radio networks.  The existence of 
recordings could open up vast potential for abuse.

Actually, old video games and pinball machines are supposed to work pretty
good (at blocking EM eavesdropping), too.   things put out a LOT of EM
noise.  Back in the 80's, I read about computer companies putting bunches
of games in  buildings for just this purpose (not to mention the $$$).

They key depositories are IRRELEVANT. In  for the applicable law
enformcement agencies to be able to know what keys to request from
, the system will have to squawk its serial number in clear text
as part of the link establishment protocol. Whoever owns the program 
that assigns keys to each serial number won't need access to the key
depository.

In other words, the FBI may need a -ed release of ed
keys, but the NSA has the keys before the chip is ever manufactured.
 is no need to go through the  or to try all keys. 
relations between law enforment agencies have sometimes been strained,
 is also a long history of trading favors. This will re-establish
the NSA as a very important agency for everyone to get along with,
because they can give you untraceable encryption leaks without 
s.

The more I  about this affair, the fouler it smells. I'd rather
have a DES with an engineered-in backdoor ...

It does give privacy, just not absolute privacy.  The announcement was very 
up front about this, and about allowing wiretaps.  How is this "fooling" 
anyone?

Sure.  The two  interoperate.  You couldn't talk to, say, a Cylink phone 
from a  phone.  I  expect even multiprotocal phones to come with 
indicators saying which kind of link encryption is in use...

    Notwithstanding all the legitimate fuss about this proposal, how much
of a change is it?  ATT's last product in this area (a) was priced over
$1000, as I suspect '' phones will be; (b) came to the customer 
with the key automatically preregistered with government authorities. Thus,
aside from attempting to further legitimize and solidify the fed's posture,
 seems to be "more of the same", rather than a new direction.
   Yes, technology will eventually drive the cost down and by promote
more widespread use- but at present, the man on the street is not going
to purchase a $1000 crypto telephone, especially when the guy on the other
end probably doesn't have one anyway.  Am I missing something?
   The real question is what the gov will do in a year or two when air-
tight voice privacy on a phone line is as close as your nearest pc.  That
has got to a problematic scenario for them, even if the extent of usage
never surpasses the 'underground' stature of PGP.

  But, if you are making custom equipment in any case, why not just
roll your own  implementation and report the wrong keys to the
 agency?  (Tells us who is going to be in the chip business if
this thing goes through--NSA, and  with something to hide from
NSA.)

  If anyone can verify that your phone is not using the key registered
to that serial number, either:

  1) They have a  ed wiretap.  But what are they going to
do?  Tell the judge that this individual  does have privacy?
All they know is that the keys are not enough, but not why.

  2) They have a  ed wiretap on a phone in this series.
(This part is  scary.   the "expectation" is that all
chips in a particular batch will uses seeds based on the same S1 and
S2 and the serial number, getting the keys for one of a batch may give
access to all.)

  3)  is a backdoor which allows all messages to be deciphered
without the keys.  I find this one especially threatening  the
scheme seems very open to known plaintext attacks.  (What I need to
decipher is the data in the header.  If I talk to someone who has one
of  phones, presumably  will be an automatically negotiated
key generated.  I'm not trying to decipher the record of the
conversation to know what was said, I use it as a known plaintext to
recover the backdoor represented by the header, but I know what the
header says for conversations I participate in.  Even worse, if the
phones in a series have related keys, I can buy a phone/chip from the
same production lot.  Then I can recover its keys, either elegantly by
talking to myself, or by brute force analysis of the actual chip, then
apply the key generation process with  seeds to find the target
keys.)

    Hmmm!  I   I want to ever come close to  phones.
Even DES is starting to look good.  Two cans and a string will provide
much better security.

I can see high-voltage type display devices  vulnerable (CRTs,

about EM radiation from low-voltage items like LCD displays?

Perhaps the critical element is the driver circuitry?  The cabling?
What about a portable PC/Mac/etc., where all the "noise" is bunched

Thousands?  Tens of thousands?  Do some arithmetic, please...  Skipjack
has 2^80 possible keys.  Let's assume a brute-force engine like that
hypothesized for DES:  1 microsecond per trial, 1 million chips.  That's
10^12 trials per second, or about 38,000 years for 2^80 trials.  Well,
maybe they can get chips running at one trial per nanosecond, and build
a machine with 10 million chips.  Sure -- only 3.8 years for each solution.

IDEA uses 128-bit keys.  Shall I bother doing the calculations for you?
Hint:  multiply 3.8 years by 2^(128-80).  And you can't do IDEA at that
speed; key setup takes much too long.  I n't be surprised if that
were the case for Skipjack, too, though 's no way of knowing just
yet.  DES used only xor because that's what was feasible with mid-70's
technology.  Modern chips can do a lot more.

NSA may or may not know how to crack Skipjack and IDEA (I doubt it for
the former; I have no idea for the latter, though it does seem to be a
strong cryptosystem).  But it ain't gonna be by exhaustive search.

Why doing it in such a rough manner? It is much more professional to
steal the chip from the phone and even to replace it with a
pin-compatible do-nothing chip that does not encrypt at all. Chances
are that the victim will not notice anything, especially if it is done
professionally.

No, because the Feds will  be able to decrypt the conversations.
True, they'll blame the wrong guys, but nevertheless one cannot say
something like "The drugs arrive tommorrow on the ship 'Terminus'"
when the Feds are listening, even if they cannot identify who the
speaker is.

No, the criminals will just use some secure encryption. The new
proposal does not stop criminals; it ensures that the government will
be able to wiretap the average citizen and stops the casual snooper.
To me, it also clearly looks as a step towards outlawing any other
strong encryption devices.

It depends on the algorithm used. 128-bit secret keys for RSA are

Well, I'm not a lawyer, but from what I can tell this is completely
and utterly untrue.

You see, this country has this thing called a "constitution".

If you legitimately aquire the device, and you yourself are
not a government employee or otherwise encumbered, I   they
can stop you from revealing anything about the device you can
determine. Remember the Pentagon Papers precedent? The First Amendment
applies here.

The U.S. does NOT have an official secrets act. We do have laws that
will punish you for revealing what classified information you learned
in your capacity as a government official, contractor, etc, and we
have laws that prohibit stealing such information. However, if they
sell you the chip, I can't see that they can make reverse engineering
it and revealing the details illegal.

	The majority of the discussion involving this " Chip" seems to
	pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations.  Does anyone
	know if that  this chip is designed to work primarily with analog
	signals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.

I'd lay a few bucks that its just data-in-data-out in parallel.  I suspect
to make it a phone you'd need a codec and speech compression.   
be a loss of bandwidth on the speech signal, which I suspect  scupper
any of the suggestions I've seen here about putting a different encryption
front end on it.

's no hint of any modulation scheme in the docs.  I'm sure it's purely
a digital chip.  The back end will come later, but I'm *positive* it won't
be left to the manufacturers - they all have to be the same modulation
scheme to make it easy for the NSA to tap them.

The only other possibility is that this is intended only for ISDN phones.
(Puts a whole new spin on EFFs obsession about ISDN if true, bwahahaha! ;-) )

	                  ' CHIP' to protect privacy

Politics is of course Dirty Pool, old man, and here we have a classic
example: the NSA and the administration have been working on this for
a *long* time, and in parallel with the announcement to us techies, we
see they're hitting the press with propoganda.

It's my bet the big magazines - Byte, Scientific American, et all - will
be ready to run with a pre-written government-slanted story on this in
the next issue.  ('Just keep us some pages spare boys, we'll give you
the copy in time for the presses')

We *must* get big names in the industry to write well argued pieces against
this proposal (can you call it that when it's a de facto announcement?) and
get them into the big magazines before too much damage is done.

It  be well worth folks archiving all the discussions from here 
the day of the announcement to keep all the arguments at our fingertips.  I
 between us we could write quite a good piece.

Now, who among us carries enough clout to guarantee publication?  Phil?
Don Parker?  Mitch Kapor?

One of the candidates that has been suggested for a key registration
body is the ACLU.  I  this is poor choice.   The ACLU is
essentially a group of auditors: they audit how people's civil
liberties are administered.  Traditionally, auditors do not like to get
involved in the design or operational aspects of things, and with good
reason.

When I was a systems programmer, it always infuriated me that the
auditors  come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a
security point of view, but n't tell us how to fix it.  I always
figured they just liked to critcize, without doing the work to help fix
the problem.

Then I took a stint as an auditor, and I found out the real reason.
Auditors  like to recommend solutions, because it puts them in a
bad position if they have to criticize the implementation later.  The
auditee can say, "Well, you told us this way  be OK."  It
compromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor's
job.

Taking the case at hand, suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar.
Suppose that, perhaps through some error on ACLU's part, a key half gets
away that n't, and is used to deprive someone of her civil
liberties.  The ACLU gets wind of this, and wants to take it to .
But they end up  at the same time on the side of the defendant
and of the plaintiff, which is not an easy position to be in.

 are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors: at one
place where I worked, when payroll checks were printed, they were signed
automatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine.  This drum
was kept by the auditors (who also kept the check stock), and
was brought down to Data Processing when it was time to do the checks.

I believe the difference between this situation and the key registration
situation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll
checks:  if they were done yesterday, and someone wants to do them again
today, he better be able to produce yesterday's checks so that they can
be destroyed.  Determining which of the many requests for key halves are
legit is a trickier process, one much more prone to mistakes that could
put the ACLU in a protecting-the-client versus protecting-the-ACLU
conflict of interest.

As always, my opinions are my own.

I'm attempting to write a serious policy paper examining whether the
proposed wiretap (or "") chip is a cost-effective tool for
police investigation.  That is, ignoring concerns about government
intrusions into individual privacy, is the value of easy wiretaps to
investigators greater than the cost to the communications industry,
and  customers, to support this wiretap technology?  

A rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million
dollars per year to U.S. law enforcement agencies.  (In 1990, 872 U.S.
wiretaps led to 2057 arrests,  total police expenditures of $28
billion led to 11.25 million arrests [ US Statistical Abstracts].)
I'm working on estimating this wiretap benefit more accurately, but
I'd like to ask hardware experts out  to help me with estimating
the costs of the new proposed wiretap technology.

Please send me quotable/citeable estimates for:

- How many chips which  need to be made per year to keep all
  phones with wiretap chips?
- How much  it cost to make each chip?
- How much did it cost to develop this technology in the first place?
- How much more  supporting hardware, people, etc. cost, per chip?
- What percentage cheaper  encryption chips and support have been
  if private enterprise could compete to meet customer encryption needs?
- What percentage of phone traffic  be taken up by the proposed
  "law enforcement blocks"?
- What is the total cost of handling all phone traffic per year?

Put another way, the question I'm asking is, what if each police
agency that wanted a particular wiretap had to pay for it, 
charged  share of the full social cost of forcing communication
to be wiretap compatible?   they choose to buy such wiretaps, or
 they find it more cost-effective to instead investigate crimes
in other ways?

Sorry if I was less than clear.  :-) I was erring to our own efforts
to receive export permission from NSA for the PKZIP encryption
algorithm, not to any effort on the part of Phil Katz or PKWare.

I  point out that the original version of this algorithm was
designed by Roger Schlafly and that WE (meaning Roger and myself) were
twice denied an export license for it.  The second go 'round was just
this past fall.

I had no knowledge of Phil's attempts in this.  I do not even *know* for
sure if he choose to implement the algorithm as it was designed by
Roger, though I *believe* that was at least the case for versions prior
to 2.0.  And then 's the question of key management.  :-)

And even if our applications were identical,  is no reason to
assume the NSA  treat them that way.  :-)

	I am an idiot. The plaintext that's relevant is the session key.
If you know that, you probably  need a roomful of chips, do you?
If you were going to brute force something interesting, that'd be the
message stream, which is sort of approximately known by, say, a bug in
my office. Then your roomful of chips could get the session key. Which
I change every morning.

brad@optilink.COM (Brad Yearwood) :
| If  comes to cellular phones along with legal proscriptions against
| using other cipher systems on  phones, a new and potentially dangerous
| class of crime is created.
| 
| Criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications
| (specifically the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key

    Yow - get some sleep Brad!  You mean that people (i.e. life-is-cheap
terrorists & drug-dealing warlords) who want to communicate in privacy will
per to break into my house, kill or kidnap me, and steal my telephone,
rather than:

        - Spending $15 at K-mart to buy a new phone.

        - Purchasing a load of phones from the black market / flea market /
          super market.

        - Talking (*gasp*) face-to-face.

        - Walking down to any one of millions of pay phones.

        - Using messengers.

        - Going to excruciating effort to  of code phrases like "I had
          a blowout on the freeway today".

    Look, this system does nothing to threaten folks who _know_ they're
 wiretapped,  it's trivial to find other avenues of communication;
they'd have no reason to resort to extreme measures,  a plethora of
simple alternatives are easily available to them.

    Among all the legitimate reasons to damn the proposed system, I 
 we need to worry about terrorist commie drug warlord assasin thugs
murdering our families, kicking the dog and leaving the toilet seat up just
to steal a $15 telephone.  The system is more like urine testing:  it
catches some small number of very stupid people, has no effect on the "bad
guys" with at least three neurons working in unison who wish to subvert it,
and penalizes most heavily  who have no cause to be  to it.

I've been a very intent NREN spectator of the NREN for years.  As a 
commercial IP software vendor, it  is my professional opinion that the 
NREN, at this point, is irrelevant to private sector networking.  If it had 
been deployed five years ago, it  have been a major development.  Now,
however, it's just an upgrade to the NSFnet, and an attempt to revive the 
lagging use of the national supercomputer centers.  You could cut out the 
NSFnet completely, and the Internet  continue chugging along without a 
hiccup (aside from a few universities).

Long-haul networking and Internet connectivity have long  ceased to be 
under federal sponsorship or regulation, at least in the USA.  The success of 
the CIX (Commercial Internet Exchange) is a prime example of this.   our 
dear VP has been promoting his "data superhighway," the private sector has 
been building it, without the NSFnet's restrictions.

To illustrate, a connection from the machine on my desk to the machine your 
 was posted from (pizzabox.demon.co.uk) involves *only* commercial IP 
providers until it hits Amsterdam.  No NSFnet.  No NREN.  No "appropriate 
use" restrictions.  It's even 1.544mbps (T1) until it hits the EUnet 
gateway...

QED.

The only way to view this method of generating unit keys is as a back-door.
What else can you call a key deterministically generated from the serial
number?


 To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is
   first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.
   S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a
   64-bit block R1:

	   R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .

   Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and
   N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  

	   R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] 
	   R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .

   R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The
   first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The
   rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2
   are the key parts that are separately ed with the two 
   agencies.


What happens is that the need for the  houses is completely eliminated.
Or  I say, the need to _access_ the  houses to decrypt the data.
The houses will  serve a real purpose as far as generating the illusion
of protection, and small-town cops won't be let in on the "secret", so they
will  go through the motions of going to the  houses, but the fact
is __the Federal government CAN and WILL build a chip which generates the unit
keys from the encrypted serial number!__  'Nuff Said.

I find this a very disturbing view!  Yes, we DO care about EVERYONE's
privacy... Even if "they"  know it. What happens if the gov't
starts creating legislation such that the  and such
technologies become the only "legal" encryption forms?  What happens
when the  is the *ONLY* type of encryption chips available to
the masses?

Sure, you might have your own method of encryption, but if you 
have anyone else to talk to, what use is it?  You can't assume that
EVERYONE will be as open as you appear to be about encryption.

The point here is not the specific instance of the Wiretap Chip.
Rather, it is like having the government telling you that they want a
copy of your house key, safe-deposit box keys, etc., and telling you
that "they wont use them unless its totally neccessary."  I sure
n't want that.  Why  encryption be any different?

	Actually, I've been following her remarks for some time, with
interest. I'm also a member of academia, and her remarks have nothing
but elevate her respectability in my eyes. It remains to be seen whether
you are the radical fringe, or I.

	It is generally an error to assume that your beliefs are held by

	 I  it is unrealistic to suppose that the federal
agencies will fail to promptly comply with a  ,  is 
 a good point here.  Local law enforcement will be unable to perform
a wiretap without bringing in federal agencies.   Based on the (possibly
incomplete) understanding of the system quoted from D. Denning, only the
FBI will be able to decrypt the system key encryption layer, which seems
to be needed even to identify what ed keys to request.  This moves
a great deal of law enforcement power to the federal level.
	The reason I like this point is that it may sway or even persuade
people who  generally line up with the civil liberties crowd.  A
national police force is opposed by people from a broad range of political 
viewpoints.

I'm not sure it is a major limiting move... in the academic circles
I've seen, arguing for increased government intervention and
management is almost always a plus (not the least because it usually
 more high paying jobs for academics as "advisors").  Also
consider that it looks like Denning has some decent NSA / government
connections, which is always a plus for an academic institute that
wants more government funding and work tossed  way.

Despicable, yes; career limiting, well, the publicity probably
outweighs the drawbacks.  And  are a whole bunch of people who
 the whole thing is just peachy keen. If it's only going to be
used against drug dealers, child pornographers, and terrorists, well
it must be good. :p

  Assuming that the bad guys can easily obtain substitute chips which 
cause any noticeable effect to either the user or the person at the other end
of the line (if  is any significant difficulty to obtaining such chips,
some of the criminals will decide to fall back on the murder/kidnap method).

 This assumes that the Feds are tapping  phones belonging to ordinary
citizens (getting such a phone is the whole point of the crime under
discussion).  To be sure, I n't put it past them -- but raising the
possibility of such crime has the benefit of forcing the Feds to either
'fess up about such intentions in advance or state that using 
exposes the user to an additional criminal threat. <g>

  Which is to say: is the NSA -totally- perfidious, or does it at least
have the redeeming virtue of taking care of its own? <g>

First, what the fuck is NASA doing wasting my tax dollars doing
policy papers on stuff far outside of  purvew/mission?
                                                                         
Second, this isn't a problem of economics.  This is a problem of
the incremental accumulation of police-state powers by our government.
 
How, exactly, do you put a price on the loss of freedom of a society?
Maybe use the dollars/life lost calculations for the extra people
killed by the gov.  The pain and suffering cases for  tortured.
The dollars/life lost caused by the inevitable collapse of the economy,
and all the secondary effects of diseases, diet, etc.  Plus, the
inevitable collapse of the economy as the gov controls it, becomes 
corrupt, etc.

Do us a favor.  Resign rather than right this paper for NASA.  Go
do useful work for the society.

Here are four pseudo-random character generators, based on
irreducible trinomials.  Each contains 16 separate trinomials,
one of which is selected on initialization ( are 64
distinct trinomials between the 4 PRCGs).  The PRCGs are
initialized with a 32-bit seed, and a 4-bit trinomial-
selector.

I  like to get comments on  by anyone who is
interested enough to look them over.  Please email,
because our news is on the fritz (Note that this was
posted via email).

It seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications
 be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future
probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained.  I can even imagine this
 found legal and constitutional,  nothing is actually listened to
until a valid warrant is issued and the keys are obtained.

Imagine archiving all pay-phone conversations, so if someone turns out
to be a drug dealer, you can listen to all  past drug deals.  And
archive calls to/from suspected Mafia members, potential terrorists,
radicals, etc.  Imagine the convenience for the police of  able to
get a warrant now and listening to all the calls the World Trade Center
bombers made in the past year.

 archiving  be such a powerful tool and so easy to do, why
n't it happen?

Read this through once or twice.  Then replace "prince" with
"government" or "president", as appropriate, and read it again.  

[From Chapter XX of _The Prince_, by N. Macchiavelli, as translated by
Daniel Donno.]

	In  to keep  lands secure, some princes have
disarmed  s; others have prompted division within the
cities they have subjugated.  Some have nurtured animosities against
themselves; others have sought to win the approval of  they
initially distrusted.  Some have erected fortresses; others have
destroyed them.  Now, although it is impossible to set down definite
judgements on all of  measures without considering the particular
circumstances of the states where they may be employed, I shall
nevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the  itself
will allow.

	To begin with,  has never been a case of a new prince
disarming his s.  Indeed, whenever he found them disarmed, he
proceeded to arm them.  For by arming your s, you make 
arms your own.   among them who are suspicious become loyal,
  who are already loyal remain so, and from s they
are transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all,
nonetheless you increase your safety among  you leave unarmed by
extending privileges to  you arm.  Your different treatment of
the two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you, 
the former will consider it proper thoat  who assume added duties
and dangers  receive advantages.  

	When you disarm your s, however, you offend them, by
showing that, either from cowards or from lack of faith, you
distrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you.
Moreover,  it is impossible for you to remain unarmed, you 
have to resort to mercenaries, whose limitations have already been
discussed. Even if such troops were good, however, they could never be
good enough to defend you from powerful enemies, and doubtful
s.  Theore, as I have said, a new prince in a newly acquired
state has always taken measures to arm his s, and history is
full of examples proving that this is so.

	But when a prince takes posession of a new state which he
annexes as an addition to his original domain, then he must disarm all
the s of the new state except  who helped him to acquire
it; and , as time and occasion permit, he must seek to render
soft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of
the entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to
his original domain.

	...

	And  the  demands it, I will not fail to remind
any prince who has acquired a new state by the aid of its inhabitants
that he soundly consider what induced them to assist him; if the
reason is not natural affection for him, but rather dissatisfaction
with the former government, he will find it extremely difficult to
keep them friendly, for it will be impossible to please them.  If he
will caully  the matter through in the light of examples drawn
from ancient and modern affairs, he will understand why it is much
easier to win the favor of  who were happy with  former
government, and hence were his enemies, than to keep the favor of
 who, out of dissatisfaction with the former rule, helped him to
replace it.

   It depends on the attack.  Adding a bit to the key doubles the amount of
work to be done in a straight brute-force attack, where you try every single
possible key until one works.  Processing and storage requirements for this
kind of attack on a 128-bit key seem like they ought to make it effectively
impossible.  However,  may be other attacks whose difficulty is (for
example) proportional to, say, 2**sqrt(n), or some such.  Also, a long
key does you little good if  is a way to incrementally guess a little
of the key at a time....

(the date I have for this is 1-26-93)

note Clinton's statements about encryption in the 3rd paragraph..  I guess
this statement doesen't contradict what you said, though.

--- cut here ---

        WASHINGTON (UPI) -- The War on Drugs is about to get a fresh
start, President Clinton told delegates to the National Federation
of Police Commisioners convention in Washington.
        In the first speech on the drug issue  his innaugural,
Clinton said that his planned escalation of the Drug War `` make
everything so far seem so half-hearted that for all practical
purposes this war is only beginning now.'' He repeatedly emphasized
his view that ``regardless of what has been tried, or who has tried
it, or how long they've been trying it, this is Day One to me.''
The audience at the convention, whose theme is ``How do we spell
fiscal relief?  F-O-R-F-E-I-T-U-R-E,'' interrupted Clinton frequently
with applause.
        Clinton's program, presented in the speech, follows the
outline given in his campaign position papers: a cabinet-level Drug
Czar and ``boot camps'' for first-time youthful offenders.  He did,
however, cover in more detail his plans for improved enforcement
methods.  ``This year's crime bill will have teeth, not bare gums,''
Clinton said.  In particular, his administration will place strict
controls on data formats and protocols, and require the registration
of so-called ``cryptographic keys,'' in the hope of denying drug
dealers the ability to communicate in secret.  Clinton said the
approach could be used for crackdowns on other forms of underground
economic activity, such as ``the deficit-causing tax evaders who
live in luxury at the expense of our grandchildren.''
        Clinton expressed optimism that the drug war can be won
``because even though not everyone voted for Bill Clinton last
November, everyone did vote for a candidate who shares my sense of
urgency about fighting the drug menace.  The advocates of
legalization -- the advocates of surrender -- may be very good at
making noise,'' Clinton said.  ``But when the American people cast
 ballots, it only proved what I knew all along -- that the
advocates of surrender are nothing more than a microscopic fringe.''

This only makes sense if the government prohibits alternative non-ed
encryption schemes. Otherwise, why not just use the front end without
?

I'd lost the White House's deathless prose when I posted (that's what happens
when you read news at home when you're rat-arsed), but I did have a bunch
of follow-ups going on about cellular/cordless comms.  The original 
has reappeared, so:

    The President today announced a new initiative that will bring
    the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary
    program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
    communications  meeting the legitimate needs of law
    enforcement.

Hmm, telephone communications could indeed include end-to-end encryption on
ordinary land.

    The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
    accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
    telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.

But the next paragraph says telecoms networks and wireless communications
links.

OK, it's far from clear exactly what Cripple (what an apposite anagram) will
be applied to, but the reason Joe Public wants secure comms is to stop
people listening in to his cellular or cordless phones (and he n't
even be bod about that were it not for Wingnut and Squidqy's
misfortunes).

Yes, Cripple *might* be for end-to-end encyption, dropping to clear
when the other end doesn't have Cripple.  But then a cordless-to-ordinary
conversation  be in clear leaving the cordless end just as vulnerable
as at present.  Nope, I suspect that Cripple will only be used on radio
links.

OK, it's possible `telecommunications networks' could mean `ordinary phone
', but I'm betting it  the microwave links used by the telcos.

My apologies if I'm wrong, particularly if the turgid Press Release makes it
clear that I'm wrong and I missed it, but as far as I can see it was full of
obfuscation, and anyone expecting end-to-end encryption is in for a surprise
(IMHO).


BTW, Graham, I've posted questions to alt.security.pgp and not seen any
replies/followups from outside Europe - how about you?  Have I made it into
everyone's kill file, or is  some problem?

Read it again yourself, then re-apply the admonition you gave to the
previous poster to yourself, as well.  The first clause is not a condition,
it is a reason for explicitly supporting the right WHICH EXISTS, MILITIA
OR NOT, that the people have a right to keep and bear arms.  This is
NOT a right granted by the Constitution, it is a right presumed to exist
by default.  The Constitution mentioning a right is to prevent the
government from removing that right by stating very clearly the government
shall NOT infringe (mess with, block, limit) that right.  Remember the
Constitution is a bunch of negative things - things the government CANNOT
do.  All rights, etc not epxressly given to the government go to the
states and the PEOPLE (the same people the other 9 Amendments in the
Bill of Rights talk about).

 I am sure you will summarily reject my interpretation, I am
appending a linguistic analysis by one far more expert than myself (and
you, I suspect).  I am sure you will find his qualifications adequate.
If that isn't enough I can send you the Senate Subcommitee to the
Judiciary on the Constitution report on the same thing...   are
some things in  that Big Brother types, like Biden, etc must have
 had to swallow hard to admit.

I  you will find that people that seriously study the Constitution
and state what it  will say the same thing.   who come up
with 'new improved meanings' are  who are trying to subvert the
Constitution for a given agenda.  Like Clinton and his Clinton Cripple,
Gun Control, People Control, and Control Control, and the whole nasty
mess.

Please tell us how this person is in error, won't you? (And please back it
up with some proof,  I am backing my assertion up with independent
proof, and have a BUNCH MORE I can provide...).

			THE UNABRIDGED SECOND AMENDMENT

			      by J. Neil Schulman

If you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan,
right ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call
 be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who  you call
if you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning
of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?

That was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los
Angeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton
Mifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the
foremost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.
Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor
journalism at the  of Southern California and the author of
"American Usage and Style: The Consensus."

A little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's
expertise.

Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades
before embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at
USC.   1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the
professional aspects of journalism for "Editor and Publisher", a weekly
magazine focusing on the journalism field.

He's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam
Webster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's
fifth book on usage, "American Usage and Style: The Consensus," has been in
continuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold  1981, and is the winner
of the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.

That sounds like an expert to me.

After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced
myself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent
the following letter:

"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in
English usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United
States Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.

"The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, 
necessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep
and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'

"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the
sentence, 'A well-regulated Militia,  necessary to the security of a
free State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect
to the independent clause containing the  of the sentence, 'the
right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'

"I  request that your analysis of this sentence not take into
consideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted
entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,
 your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation
regarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever
analysis you make be a professional opinion that you  be willing to
stand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under
oath to support, if necessary."

My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,
then concluded:

"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task
with this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is
vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.
 I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of
its results, I ask that you do this because of that importance."

After several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for
his doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our
opinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political
, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have
inserted my questions for the sake of clarity):

[Copperud:] "The words 'A well-regulated militia,  necessary to the
security of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your
letter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a
clause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is
followed by the main clause of the sentence ( 'the right', verb
'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for
maintaining a militia.

"In reply to your numbered questions:

[Schulman:] "(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep
and bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?"

[Copperud:] "(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear
arms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by
others than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect
to a right of the people."

[Schulman:] "(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted
by the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a
preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state
that such right 'shall not be infringed'?"

[Copperud:] "(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence
is assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be
preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia."

[Schulman:] "(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms
conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact
necessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not
existing, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,
shall not be infringed' null and void?"

[Copperud:] "(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to
keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence
of a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the
right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated
militia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep
and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence."

[Schulman:] "(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia,  necessary
to the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place
conditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such
right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?"

[Copperud:] "(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as
previously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the
militia."

[Schulman:] "(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated
militia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,'
'well-educated,' or ' to regulations of a superior authority'?"

[Copperud:] "(5) The phrase  ' to regulations of a superior
authority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian
control over the military."

[Schulman:] "(6) (If at all possible, I  ask you to take account the
changed meanings of words, or usage,  that sentence was written 200
years ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the
intents of the authors, unless  issues can be clearly separated."

[Copperud:] "To the best of my knowledge,  has been no change in the
meaning of words or in usage that  affect the meaning of the
amendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: " a
well-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the
right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'

[Schulman:] "As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I  also
appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second
Amendment to the following sentence,

"A well-schooled electorate,  necessary to the security of a free
State, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be
infringed.'

"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence  be,

"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way
the words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?;
and

"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people
to keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for
example, registered voters with a high-school diploma?"

[Copperud:] "(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the
amendment in grammatical structure.

"(2)  is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the
possibility of a restricted interpretation."

Professor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his
cover letter: "With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative
efforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach
any conclusion."

So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what
many knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally
protects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all
governments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.

As I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the
Soviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that
part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the
old guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.

And here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed
officials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States
ignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.
American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning
arms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements
regarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an
abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,
guaranteed by the Constitution.

And even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the
rest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.

it seems it is up to  who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to
preserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our
elected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding
them as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who
decide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it  but
 whatever they say it  in  Orwellian doublespeak ?

Or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution
of the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend
that promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?

			About the Author

J. Neil Schulman is the award-winning author of novels endorsed by Anthony
Burgess and Nobel-economist Milton Friedman, and writer of the CBS "Twilight
Zone" episode in which a time-traveling historian prevents the JFK
assassination.  He's also the founder and president of SoftServ Publishing,
the first publishing company to distribute "paperless books" via personal
computers and modems.

Most recently, Schulman has founded the Committee to Enforce the Second
Amendment (CESA), through which he intends to see the individual's right to
keep and bear arms recognized as a constitutional protection equal to 
afforded in the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth and Fourteenth amendments.

I  your experiences under the Bulgarian regime are highly relevant.
We have too many people with  heads in the sand saying it cannot
happen here, as our Constitutional Rights are  trashed every day
because the government justifies doing some end-run around the protections
by a 'crisis' requiring 'drastic action'.   It is most likely that in the
future possession of secure encryption tools will be regarded as possession
of 'terrorist and drug dealers tools', and be some serious Fedaral Felony.
Just like common tools are 'burgular tools' if the police say so, common
computer programs (even computers themselves) are now 'hackers tools',
and will become 'terrorist tools'.  BET ON IT.

The insights of someone who has lived throught this are very important.
If the US goes the way of the old Soviet Union and its client states
as far as individual rights, privacy and overall freedom are concerned,
the rest of the world (remember 'New World '?) will not be far
behind - only a few years.

Please keep posting anything you find that is deficient or that threatens
ones rights in this thing.

For example, a conversation between a suspect and a lawyer will no longer
be private from Big Brother eavesdropping.  Political dissent allready
is very dangerous in this country, all it takes is the government to
decide that enough people will take one seriously, then one becomes
guilty of 'plotting to overthrow the government by illegal '.  The
phrase 'illegal ' is defined as whatever the government wants it
to be defined as.

Couple this with Clinton's pressing for a 'smart' National ID card (an
'Internal passport'?), with the added wrinkle that anything about you and
your past can be put on it, and you can only take the government's
word as to what is  on it ( they will be the only ones
with the  to completely read and reprogram the thing).  Isn't
that nice?

 the Feds can bust into one's safe without the keys, the owner
knows his safe has been broken into.  When they break into your 'secure'
phone conversations (or other stored/transmitted data in the near future)
you have no way of knowing, so accountability as to the legalities has
gone out the window.  Just like a safe, if they have a legal cause, they
can get the keys from the suspect, just like they can get the keys to
a safe or the combination from the suspect.  Same with encryption:
Record everything, get the warrants, THEN decode it with the keys
obtained from the suspect.

This Clinton Cripple, along with its natural extensions, will make any
priviliged communications between client and lawyer, and any meaningful
political dissent virtually impossible.  Which is the general idea.
Any propeganda about its  secure, and the safeguards, and all
of that are just that - propeganda to reassure people so they will
by into this monstrosity.   BE SUCKERED.

BIG BROTHER IS LISTENING!!!

Some countries have laws about importing crypto gear--I believe the U.S.
does. Without a license the above scheme won't work (at least not legally)
in such countries, including at least France and the U.S.

This won't work if  is a checksum on the keys you  know about.
Neither will registering a  chip and then substituting a
"counterfeit" one if the serial number contains a checksum.

Chances are the government has thought of this, and "just anyone" won't be
permitted access to enough of the internals to make a "fake"  chip.
Chances are that the government has classified some details of the internals
at a very high level, and manufacturers are required to observe security
safeguards and clearances corresponding to that level.

 not perfect, it  prevent Joe Hacker from rolling his own spoofing
chip,  not many counterfeiters can survive a background investigation.
Some of the more notorious self-styled dissidents here, for example, have
already got  heads so high above the tall grass that they'd have little
chance of getting a clearance.

Of course it's not impossible that someone do this, but probably extremely
difficult. Chances are  will also be very heavy criminal penalties for
phony  chips, on some national security/classified info grounds or
other, thus making the game not worth the candle.

Actually the govrnment is telling you that if you want to use 
"product" the manufacturer (actually better yet, some "trusted" pair
of  agencies) has to have the key.

Most of us already are in this situation--our car makers have keys to our
cars (or can get them quickly from the VIN  number), and I have no doubt
that if presented with a  , they'd surrender copies to the
government.

Chances are that many locksmiths have the code numbers for house locks
they've installed, and in an emergency can cut keys; thus they'd also
provide such keys to the government pursuant to a  .

The state has no difficulty gaining access to your safe deposit box if they
have a  .

Bad analogy.

This is not to argue for or against the proposal, but rather better
distinctions are required in ing about it than "house key, safe-deposit
keys, etc.".

 I  know the full scope of the activities of the EFF, 
from what little I've seen I  it  be better to lobby for 
strong cryptography through a distinct .

The EFF has been associated with efforts to prevent the banning of sex
and pictures  at various universities. Horror stories about the
contents of  groups (e.g. exploitative pictures of possibly underaged
models) have already surfaced in the press. The White House bulletin
already raised the specter of drug-dealing and terrorism, which is only one
step removed from the old "crypto-wielding child molester" argument.  An
EFF lobbying effort for cryptography  be too easily derailed by the
connection to child pornography and the like.

Similarly, LPF is connected with Stallman and his Gnu project.  In
light of, say, the Gnu Manifesto, this  that in a public debate it
stands to be labelled as "communist", "anarchist hackers", radical, etc.  

I  know about CPSR, but if it is an offshoot of Physicians for Social
Responsibility (best known for Helen Caldicott and her hysterical
antinuclear lobbying) then it probably also carries unwelcome political
baggage.

Perhaps for practical reasons a lobbying  for cryptography
 best be formed under the umbrella of EFF or some other existing
group, but its charter  then be distinct, independent, and limited to
advocacy for the right to cryptography.  To reiterate Dan Bernstein's
question: does any suitable  exist?  If not, what are you going
to do about it?

Having mentioned the possible dangers of unwelcome political associations,
I  be remiss not to suggest something in the opposite direction:
gathering the support of the NRA by emphasizing the RKBA side of the
issue as well as the First-Amendment side.

Whats the difference between a V.32bis modem and a V.32bis modem?

I'm not  entirely silly here: what I'm pointing out is that the
modems that they have already approved for data transmission will work
just fine to transmit scrambled vocoded voice.

  OK, Doug is right, it  be obstruction of justice, blah blah blah,
BUT, saying "I forgot" is a lie, which is just as bad from a moral point
of view _IF_ you  "lawfulness" is a good in and of itself (which 
admittedly most people do not.)  But 's an even better way out of this.
PROVIDED the government is prosecuting you criminally, you can probably
plead the fifth amendmeent and thus LEGALLY avoid revealing your key.  The
government cannot demand information from a criminal defendant which "may
tend to incriminate" that defendant.  Though this has never been applied
in the cryptography context (at least as far as I can tell) it seems an
obvious application to me.  

 This may be a common suggestion in this group, but if it's not (I'm new
here) I'd love to hear what people have to say about it.   I 
 read this group (and  the  matter is more legal than
cryptoid) maybe misc.legal.computing  be an appropriate place?

The people on usenet are clearly a special bunch.  We live the net, which
is the future of our culture.  Usenetters have rapid electronic access to
information.  Society in general must depend on CNN.  

I can only hope we can make this information accessable by the public before
the radical fringe, which _is_ the majority, destroys the fabric of
this country.  Freedom is never easily won.

 OK, I  have read the thread before posting my own $0.02.  I 
just add to Phil's very infomative discussion the following caveat: the
fifth amendment applies ONLY in crinial cases.  ("...nor shall any person .
. . be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself...").
Thus if the father sued for custody of the children, the case  be
civil and the defendant mother  not have fifth amendment protection.
Oddly enough, her usal to give information in a civil case can lead to
criminal contempt charges (thus landing her in jail.)  The interesting part
of all this is that in a murder trial, the woman CAN plead the fifth as 
to the location of the child--this is routine.  A "computer crime" 
prosecution thus  seem to be fertile ground for this kind of defense, 
where a suit by a party injured by "hackers"  not.  If I am accused, 
for example, of sending encrypted kiddie porn over the nets the fifth  
protect my key.  If I am accused of sending copyrighted material, however,
it proabably will not (copyright infringement not  a "crime" in the
technical sense.)  The  tricky question is, say I do both (naughty
boy that I am) can the government use the information gained in the civil
trial (ie. my key) to gain access to my files for use in the criminal
prosecution.  The answer  certainly be no, but lord only knows how
this  work out.

Steve.

anti-Semitic, and just plain filthy" books from a public high school

It  that the EFF's public stance is complicated with issues irrelevant
to the encryption issue per se.  may well be people who care about
the encryption issue who  care to associate themselves with the
network erotica issue (or may even disagree with the EFF's position).

Ending up with pallets of baggage to drag around is a frequent 
problem with permanent s. EFF is no exception.

Normally I'd be the last to argue with Steve . . . but n't that

machine that does 1 trial/nanosecond, we can imagine the storage medium
that could index and archive it.

I perhaps  have been clearer and more concise in my post, but that's
what I get from posting at 1 am...

The central point I made is that local/state police agencies attempting to
play by the rules and get warrants, legit ed keys, etc., may find
themselves at the mercy of bureaucratic inertia and agency infighting
at the federal level.  

I disagree that this  assist civil liberties by hobbling the cowboy
cops.  It  be a strong incentive, as Vesselin points out, for more
police agencies to "go rogue" and try to get keys through more efficient
(but less Constitutional) .  Notice what the release said:

   Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
        a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
        encrypted using the device.  What  they have to do to
        decipher the message?

   A:   They  have to obtain legal authorization, normally a
                                                       ^^^^^^^^^^
         , to do the wiretap in the first place.
        ^^^^^^^^^^^

The clear implication is that  are "legal" authorizations other
than a  .  Just how leaky are ?  (And who 
knows what's in  7 pages that authorized the NSA?).  
may well arise a black market of sorts _within_ police agencies, in which
keys are traded.  Furthermore, the police will be in an excellent
position to carry out this kind of thing without  caught.  They
already have a communication infrastructure with secure portions.  
are a few laws that I know of, that limit citizens' rights to access
police communications (or use the information they get).  It may be
very difficult to prove police misuse -- the fact that you have such
evidence may itself be evidence that YOU have broken some other law.

Throw in private detectives, who have even fewer policy/constitutional
restrictions.  Also consider mercenaries who've "retired" from intelligence
agencies.  William Gibson must be loving it.  Great story material.

  it'll happen?  

Well, consider e.g. the Michigan State Police, generally a very professional
, which for years kept "Red Files" on thousands of suspected 
commies, knowing full well it was not consititutional.  The standards
of evidence were just about zero: people were in the file because they
happened to park near a place where, say, a US-China People's Friendship
rally was happening -- the police went around writing down license
plate numbers.  If you happened to be visiting a friend who lived near the 
meeting place, well, the state police wound up filing you as a subversive.
(They were eventually found out and a  ruled against carrying on any
more such nonsense.  I believe thay may have had to destroy the tapes
as well.)

Even with well-meaning cops (and I'm sure  are many),  will 
be strong pressure to bend the constitutional safeguards.  We  need
to assume corrupt or unbalanced officers -- it will all be in the interest 
of enforcing sensible laws, saving lives, and protecting property.  
Compromises will be made by well-meaning officers, facing what (to them) 
will be a moral dilemma.

 will make criminals out of cops.  Do we want to do this to our
police forces?

Once the chips are released (in phones, or whatever), they are vulnerable to 
phsyical inspection and observation.  Now, I will grant that  will no 
doubt be safeguards against "peeling" the chip, but the NSA has no monopoly 
on cleverness.  The chip, and the algorithms it uses, will not remain secret 
for very long.  Any  with a VLSI lab has the required equipment, as 
does any offshore semiconductor manufacturer.

No, he gives the keys to the FBI (who may then give them to the local police
on request) who then simply put some alagator clips on your phone junction
box and conduct an illegal tap. They then decrypt when they recover the tape.
Its just doing what the government does best: breaking the law.

grady@netcom.com suggests using a common but restricted- private
key to allow public key system encrypted postings. In theory that will work
fine as long as the privae key remains secure.

In practice it  be a good idea to check to see if that  be a
violation of some net rule, practice, custom, etc. I  say it  be,
just that it  be a good idea to check. This is not like rot13 where
everybody can have the key trivially.

It  also be a good idea to check to see if such posts  be
forwarded by the sites needed to make the chain work.

Of course 'd be no problem with a discussion group travelling over
facilities entirely under the control of the members. Probably  
also be no problem with a mailing list approach. It might even  be fun for
some.

Absolutely, if I were assured by someone I trusted that the black box was
more secure. I have nothing to conceal from the government, but I  like
to be sure that any Russian, Japanese, French, or other competitors for my
services can't read my traffic. I'd like to be sure that competitive bid
information was safe from commercial competitors and foreign governments
which  aid them.

I believe the NSA has identical motivations with respect to my activities.
The President and many other senior government officials have made it very
clear that they share  motivations. Thus I'd trust them on the
"coincidence of interests" argument as well as on a basic trust in 
professionalism and a high confidence in  skills.

   Hmmmm.  I , with  large keyspaces like this, you need to
alter the strategy discussed for DES.  Attempt decryption of several
blocks, and check the disctribution of the contents.  I   it's
at all feasible to keep 2**80 encryptions of a known plaintext block on
*any* amount of tape or CD-ROM.  And certainly not 2**128 such encrypted
blocks.  (Anyone know a cheap way of converting every atom in the solar
system into a one bit storage device?)
 
   Actually, a keysearch of this kind n't be much worse than the
simpler kind in terms of speed.  It's just that you have to do it over
for *every* encrypted message.
 
   Dumb question:  Has anyone ever done any serious research on how many
legitimate ASCII-encoded 8-byte blocks  are that could be part of
an english sentence?  For attacking DES in ECB mode, it seems like a
dictionary of this kind might be pretty valuable....

er, excuse me but  the  agencies aren't yet chosen, how can you
say they have a "history of untrustworthy behavoir[sic]"?

I'm sure each of us can  of agencies without such a history. Price
Waterhouse has kept the secret of the Academy Awards for many years, even in
the face of an aggressive press. The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee
has successfully kept decisions from leaking for the statutory period until
publication. Even the Department of Agriculture has successfully kept crop
forecasts from leaking prematurely.

Frankly, I'd trust the above (not the D of A, of course  they might be
 to political pressure) far sooner than the ACLU, EFF, or CPSR which,
though not exactly government apologists, have no particular track record
for internal security that I know of.

I  claim to be a crypto analyist...  isn't a whole lot of good
literature on the , and the best people  seem to publish
 work :)  but I rather doubt the approach such folks use is brute
force (sorry to have implied that in my previous post).  The history
of  things is folks find clever ways of limiting the search and
bang from .

I guess my real problem with Skipjack is I can not believe NSA 
make publicly available a system they couldn't break if they wanted...
it just isn't in  charter.  Remember DES came from IBM, not NSA
and, when first published, was given a useful life of 20 years... I 
we are well past that point now :(

Remember, based on the size of the NSA budget, they spend a lot more
on the technology of decryption than most computer companies spend on
R&D.  I have to imagine  stuff is real interesting...

A friend who once worked for them (he is dead now) said he always enjoyed
monitoring SAC's (Strategic Air Command) crypto traffic :)  and I rather
suspect that stuff is a bit more complex than Skipjack  (Or was it the
military got the stuff from the NSA just like we get Skipjack from them ;)
[BTW, folks, NSA wasn't  given the keys.  And the Walker spy case
shows for some of the systems, the KGB didn't need them either.]

I may be an anarchist nutcase, but I n't have frothed overmuch
had the government proposed a secure encryption standard.  In fact,
if the NSA had come up with a privacy chip rather than a wiretap
chip, I  have been happy.  They *could* have done this -- set
up an ANSI committee, picked a secure cryptosystem, defined a
protocol and interface, and said, "Hey, start building them."

Instead we have a deliberately brain-dead version of a cryptosystem
that has not even been peer reviewed.  Yes, the NSA owns some smart
people.  But if they pulled a FEAL, well, AT&T is going to be left
with a lot of dud phones on its hands.

Heh heh.  The government already gave it up for us.  Remember in the
announcement they described this scheme as balancing the two
extremes of having no privacy and claiming that citizens had a
Constitutional right to encryption?  

So much for Clinton's support of the "right of privacy".

I apologize for  so dense but this sentence reads as if it
was lifted from a Luis Bunuel screenplay.  Am I missing something?
Why on earth  drug smugglers even _use_ the device then?
Obviously, they'll be using something like triple encryption DES instead.
As long as alternatives to  remain legal,  accomplishes
absolutely nothing, ZERO, as far as law enforcement is concerned.
The whole scheme is an absolute, total, incredible, waste of government
time and money AS LONG AS other encryption schemes that are any good 
remain legal.  In  for  to work as intended all strong
cryptosystems have to be outlawed.

Good question. I also wanted to find out and I did a  ago.

In our former communist times such activity (i.e. sending crypto emails)
 be prevented sooner ot later, law or no law. But now  is no law 
against it. So we are free to use it. We now have an EC conformant law for 
protection and registration of personal files. You must remember that the 
situation in small countries is vastly different from the big ones.

        CRYPTO '93  -  General Information  (August 22 - 26, 1993)
............................................................................

THE PROGRAM:  Crypto'93 is the thirteenth in a series of workshops on 
cryptology held at Santa Barbara, and is sponsored by the International 
Association for Cryptologic Research, in cooperation with the IEEE 
Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy, the Computer 
Science Department of the  of California, Santa Barbara, and 
Bell-Northern Research (a subsidiary of Northern Telecom). The program 
for the workshop will cover all aspects of cryptology. Extended abstracts of 
the papers presented at the conference will be distributed to all attendees 
at the conference, and formal proceedings will be published at a later date.

In addition to the regular program of papers selected or invited by the 
program committee,  will be a rump session on Tuesday evening for 
informal presentations. Facilities will also be provided for attendees to 
demonstrate hardware, software and other items of cryptographic interest. 
If you wish to demonstrate such items, you are urged to contact the General 
Chair so that your needs will be attended to. The social program will include 
hosted cocktail parties on Sunday and Monday. In addition,  will be a 
beach barbecue on Wednesday evening. The price of the barbecue is included 
in the room and board charge, and extra tickets may be purchased.

ABOUT THE CONFERENCE FACILITIES:  The workshop will be held on the campus of 
the  of California, Santa Barbara. The campus is located adjacent 
to the Santa Barbara airport and the Pacific Ocean. Accommodations are 
available in the  dormitories at relatively low cost for conference 
participants. Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to stay in the 
dormitories, so  bringing small children will need to make separate 
arrangements in one of several nearby hotels. More information on hotels is 
enclosed. Parking on campus is available at no cost to the participants. 
However, participants must indicate on the registration form if they desire 
a parking permit.

TRAVEL INFORMATION:  The campus is located approximately 2 miles from the 
Santa Barbara airport, which is served by several air, including 
American, America West, Delta, United, and US Air. Free shuttle bus service 
will be provided between the Santa Barbara airport and the campus on Sunday 
and Thursday afternoons. All major rental car agencies are also represented 
in Santa Barbara, and AMTRAK has rail connections to San Francisco from the 
north and Los Angeles from the south. Santa Barbara is approximately 100 miles 
north of Los Angeles airport, and 350 miles south of San Francisco.

REGISTRATION:  Participation is invited by interested parties, but attendance 
at the workshop is limited, and pre-registration is strongly advised. Late 
registrations,  to a late registration fee, may be accepted if space 
is available, but  are NO GUARANTEES. To register, fill out the attached 
registration form and return to the address on the form along with payment in

In  <15469@optilink.COM> brad@optilink.COM (Brad Yearwood) :
<If  comes to cellular phones along with legal proscriptions against
<using other cipher systems on  phones, a new and potentially dangerous
<class of crime is created.

Aside from possession of "terrorist tools" (unapproved encryption devices
or programs)...

<Criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications (specifically
<the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key  cite as threats)
<will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user, and
<to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the
<device will be delayed.
<
<Once a suitable collection of devices is stolen, criminals can communicate
<with impunity (assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from
<key ) until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other .
<
<Because life-is-cheap criminals are currently willing to kill people to steal
<very large and conspicuous property (luxury cars), it is reasonable to assume
<that they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuous
<property (a cipher cellular phone).  Just as we have seen in the past with
<"blue box" technology, and in the present with modified cellular phones,
<we can expect to see among high-stakes criminals a lucrative market for
<stolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days.  The high-stakes
<criminals will pay the life-is-cheap types substantial amounts for stolen
<instruments.
<
<Because a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days,
<a stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days.   will be a
<continuing demand for fresh phones: fresh bodies.

And  Clinton is also going full-bore to deny unconnected citizens
the  to defend themselves ("we will protect you ... 911 is good
enough for you...") by perverting or trashing the Second Amendment,
the targeted individuals will be GUARANTEED easy prey.  What is a few
bodies compared to the "greater good" of the Fed  able to defeat
a citizen's security with impunity?  You    doesn't
exist a  by which the NSA can do  usual eavesdropping, scanning
for keywords, with OR WITHOUT a   or any 'keys', do you?
If so, I got some great Florida real estate you might be interested in...

Perhaps the idea of ed keys is meant to divert the discussion to
how they will be safeguarded, and away from the basic fact that the
government is systematically taking away our right to privacy, to be
secure, for the  of self-defense, and just about every other right
spelled out in the Bill of Rights?

Nawwww - they are the GOVERNMENT!  "Trust us..."

<In other words,  and similar systems have the potential to turn a
<current inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct, vicious, and
<persistent threat to the general public.

What is more important to the government?  Law Enforcement (people control)
or the safety of the general public?  The gun control issue  answer
that one - look at how good that works in making cities safer:  The places
that are the worst in that regard are also the places with the 'best' gun
control.  Government is NOT about public good, it is about CONTROL.

Never forget that.  Our Founding Fathers sure were concerned about it.

	Whats the difference between a V.32bis modem and a V.32bis modem?

	I'm not  entirely silly here: what I'm pointing out is that the

	just fine to transmit scrambled vocoded voice.

Absolutely.  I just meant that no secure *dedicated* crypto device has
ever been given approval.  Guerrilla underground devices  be well
possible with today's high-speed modems (not that I can  of many v32bis
modems that are approved either mind you - just the overpriced Couriers)

Can someone tell me if hardware compression is or is not needed to run
digital speech down 14.4K?  I  it is; I've heard it's not.  Lets
say 8 bit samples.   *raw* data at the corresponding sampling rate
be usable?  If not, how fancy does the compression need to be?

I  know what's worse - the waste of money, or the fact that (in SPITE
of all Clinton's rhetoric to the contrary) this is a feeble attempt by
a large group of bored intelligence bureaucrats to justify  currently
useless jobs. Clinton said he was going to trim the fat from the government.
This doesn't look very dietetic to me! 

As I said before in this group: drug dealing and terrorism both tend to
be international crimes which are not going to cease if the US starts to
regulate encryption. The drug dealers and terrorists will simply go to
other countries to communicate  plans, and will  carry them out
here and/or wherever else. This is not the solution to the problem.

They try to invent a new problem by saying we "need" encryption. I guess
it's a good thing Bill Gates isn't a 4-star general or we  all "need"
our own copies of MS-DOS too, right?

This is true for the mass market, but not for  who need strong crypto
and are willing to pay the price. After all, one can buy strong crypto today
if one is willing to spend enough.

Thus the concern is not economic.

The issue most worth worrying about is that after the system takes hold, the
government will outlaw other systems, and something voluntary will become
the only system available. That is a political, not an economic issue.

As a separate matter, you may be making an implied advocacy for cheap secure
crypto for everyone. It's true that the  chip  probably prevent
that except via , but "cheap, secure crypto for everyone" is a
political discussion, not an economic one, and the whole point of  is 
to resolve that political (policy) tension between securing legitimate
communications and tapping the crooks.

Anything the administration or any governmental agency says is opinion at

   But  is a MUCH more pernicious problem with the scheme as
proposed.  Building a brute force machine to test 2^40 possible keys
if you have the other half from one  agent is EASY.  (One chip,
one test per microsecond gives you one break every two weeks, and that
break gives you all messages involving that phone.)

   The XOR scheme so that the files from one  agent gives you
nothing is an improvement, but notice that XORing with (truely random)
bit strings allows for an arbitrary number of  agents.  Using +
for XOR, SK for the ed key, and A and B for two random bit
strings, hand SK+A+B, SK+A, and SK+B to three  agents.  It is
possible to come with an encoding scheme to match any  pattern,
for example 3 of 4, such that fewer cooperating  agents gives
the cracking agency no benefit.

In most cases information you come by properly is yours to use as you wish,
but  are certainly exceptions.  If you write a paper which includes
sufficiently detailed information on how to build a nuclear weapon, it is
classified.  As I understand the law, nuclear weapons design is
_automatically_ classified even if you do the work yourself.  I believe you
are then not allowed to read your own paper.

A less serious example: if you tell drivers about a speed trap they are
about to run into, you can be fined, even though you might argue that you
broke no law when you discovered the location of the policeman.  The charge
is interfering with a police officer, which is quite similar what you 
be doing by reverse engineering the  chip.

 tell me that you  this violates the Constitution -- find some
 cases which have struck down such laws.  Many people  not be
comforted by the fact that the government violated  rights when it
imprisoned them.

Have you heard of PGP? I assume from your post that you have not. PGP 2.2
is a freeware RSA encryption program which includes digital signatures and
comprehensive key management facilities. Most sites also keep the source code.
A growing number of people are using this excellent software to encrypt (to
a very high standard)  email and data. Get it before Clinton outlaws it.

Two of the many sites are:

In  two sections the phrases `or other legal ' and `normally a
 ' imply  is some other way or ways of doing a legal
wiretap. What is/are ? How do they affect the way people who trust the
system of  s to protect them feel about this  system?

The second section shows the sequence of events.
The law enforcer, armed with his warrant, attaches his headphones to the
line with his croc-clips (remember,  are the folk who couldn't cope
with digital telephony) and hears a load of modem-like tones (we are
talking analogue telephony here).
What next? What modulation scheme do   boxes use?
Is it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained?
I thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some
intermediate point on the line. Maybe they have taken a crash course
in data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the
digital stream for decryption later. This   suffer from the
same problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator  not
be at one end of the line. If calls can't be recorded for decryption later
it  be quite easy to foil the system by buying lots of  units
( are supposed to be cheap mass market items) and using them in turn.

How tolerant is the modulation scheme to errors?  things are proposed
for use by US corporations to secure  foreign offices, where phone
line quality may well be poor. It seems hard enough to me to get digitised
speech of any quality into something a modem can handle without having to
add lots of error correction to keep the decryption in sync.

This raises an intersting question in the UK. Here it is illegal to connect
anything to a public telecomms network without it  approved by a body
called BABT. It has been stated, either here or in the uk.telecom group,
that they will not approve equipment that does encryption. I  know
if this is true or not, but this  make a good test case.
Perhaps `friendly' countries, and the UK may  qualify, will get
to fish in the ed key pool as well.

The whole issue hangs about what you mean by "wiretap".  If the signal can
be detected by "non-intrusive"  (like radio listening), then it may be
recorded and it may be "analyzed".  "Analyzed"  that it may be either
deciphered and/or radio-location may be used to locate the transmitter.

The catch is this:  Any and all record of the signal and its derivatives
may only be kept for a maximum of 90 days, after which they are destroyed
unless permission is obtained from the US Attorney General to keep them.

   Unless  has been a _major_ change in the law, 's no such beast
   as a "classified patent."  Patents exist to encourage communications and
   develop the state of the art. 

  aren't classified patents,  are "patent secrecy s".

Suppose you invent a voice scrambler for CB radio, and apply for a patent.
The Patent Office decides the NSA might be interested, gives them a copy
of your application, and you get a nice note back saying your patent
application has now been classified for national security reasons and
you're no longer allowed to make and sell it.  
I'm picking this example because it happened in the late 1970s.
It was probably some analog scrambler, and  have probably
violated FCC rules anyway, but it did get classified.

Or suppose you publish a paper on your  Spiffy Algorithm and
then file a patent application.   it's been published,
they can't gain anything by classifying it, though you can't get
patents in most countries other than the US, where patent laws are different.

Obviously a system of classified patents  be highly bogus
"You can't sell that widget, because 's a classified patent on it.
You're not allowed to see the patent, or know who owns the design,
so just give us all your money and work in progress and maybe we won't throw
you in jail for espionage."  Some countries might have that kind of
system :-(, but we  have that here.  Quite.  Yet.

That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something
they can get caught at.  And key size is one of the things that can be
verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the
chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the
output.  We already know what ** happen -- about half the output
bits  vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.

If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that
some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that
they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,
DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output
change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I  
NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.

Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see
the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased
subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The committee
can and  run lots of tests, and retain the output.  This can be verified
later against the chip.  And yes, the civilian community has at least some
secure storage facilities that I   even NSA can get into without
it  noticed, until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again.
(Oops -- I   I was supposed to talk about that...)  The committee
members can even retain secure copies of the code -- in two halves, which
you have to XOR together to recover the program...

Seriously,  are, I , problems with this whole scheme.  But the
people who invented it aren't stupid, and they've been in the crypto game
and the smoke-and-mirrors game far longer than most of us.  They're not
going to lie in ways that can be detected easily,   credibility
is the *only* thing they can use to sell this system.  If they've lied
about the civilian committee, no one will believe them about the absence
of other back doors.  If they've lied about the key size, no one will
believe that they haven't copied the programming disk with the U keys.
If they've lied about obvious aspects of the strength of the cryptosystem,
no one will believe the  agencies aren't in cahoots with them.

That isn't to say that they aren't lying about all  other things
anyway.  And I'm certainly not claiming that NSA can't build a cryptosystem
with a back door that the committee can't find -- look how long it took
for folks to believe that the S-boxes weren't sabotaged.  It's entirely
possible that the committee will release an ambiguous report, for just
such reasons.  But that's a subtle point (i.e., one you can't explain to
a Senator...).

I  like the unit key generation process any better than you do.
However -- S1 and S2 are supposed to be under control of the same
 agents.  If they can't be trusted to keep the seed values secure,
they can't be trusted to keep the half-keys secure.

I   know if or when S1 and S2 change.  I thought I had seen
something about them  constant, but I just reread Denning's technical
information post, and it doesn't say anything, one way or the other.

The willingness of the majority of the people to give up  freedom in 
exchange for a sense of safety is hardly limited to the USA, and is an 
endemic problem in any human society of any appreciable size.  The structure 
of the US government does try to combat this tendency to some extent, but 
fighting entropy is always a losing battle.  Most people  rather have 
comfort than freedom.  The paradox is that you can't  have the former, 
in the long term, unless you have the latter.

One of the reasons that I probably come across to some people as a weird 
cross between a libertarian and an "establishment tool" is that I end up 
taking an utterly pragmatic view of government.  I  get up in arms when 
the government fails to protect the interests of the people, because in my 
lifetime it never has--theore, I have no expectation that it will.  

As a result, I protect my own interests rather than expecting the government 
to be "fair".  I will use strong cryptography when I  it is needed, 
whether or not it is legal at the time.  Same thing with anything else the 
government  rather not see in private hands--that's  problem.  
What's important to me is using the right tool for the job.  If it's legal, 
so much the better.  If it is not, but does not violate my (very strong) 
sense of personal ethics, I will use it anyway as long I  it is worth 
it.  Expecting the government to actually protect the interests of its 
citizens, except by accident, is utter folly.  Even Jefferson, one of the 
major architects of the American system of government, figured that in a 
couple hundred years it  become so corrupt and self-serving that it 
 be time dismantle it and try again, by revolution if necessary.  I 
agree, and  I  go around trying to spark one, I'll certainly 
participate if it happens when I'm around.   is a reason I am such a 
strong supporter of individual rights   so cynical about politics.  
I've already written off politics.

And yes, this may get me in trouble some day.  If so, so be it.  I drive 
faster than 55 MPH, too.

Now I n't be the one to claim that you are injecting some
disinformation into the net, , but 'paranoia' ers to
unwarranted or excessive suspicions or fear, not  that
have reasonable roots.

Let's start with looking at the professionals, the NSA itself.
Its birth was by secret executive  by Harry S Truman
in 1952.  Until even 1976 not even one word of this executive
 chartering the NSA was sealed.  Paranoia, right?

On the outside of the NSA complex is a ten foot Cyclone fence
with multiple rows of barbed wire, with high voltage, complete with signs
prohibiting even making sketches under penalty of the Internal
Security Act.  The area is completely scanned by closed circuit
television.  More paranoia.

 are professionals,  Maybe they know something we , eh?

Do you  it  have helped Admiral Yamamoto if the Japanese
had been a little more 'paranoid' of  purple cipher?

Or maybe the Germans  have been a little more 'paranoid' about
 Engima with respect to Turing and the British.

How about the cracking of the Zimmerman telegram?   a little
more paranoia have helped the Germans here?

Maybe the NSA  have been a little more 'paranoid' about
Emma Woikin, or Joseph Sidney Petersen, Jr., or  ...

Maybe you want to talk about Macmillan publishers cooperation
with the CIA and NSA to suppress Yardley's Japanese Diplomatic
Secrets or even Kahn's The Codebreakers.. paranoia, right?

The most popular cipher systems in captured soviet spies was
the one-time pad, even with the necessity of keeping incriminating
evidence about, is known to be the only proven unbreakable system.
Soviet paranoia, right?

And what do you  the NSA does with its Wullenwebers?  And 
huge Rhombics pointed embassy row?  And  sites near
satellite uplink and downlink sites?  Duh.

When I worked in a classified MITRE communications lab at one time
even with a "secret" clearance I had to be escorted to the toilet
and the entire site was built INTO a Mosler-type vault with *very*
thick bomb-proof door.  MITRE paranoia?

I could cite probably a hundred more facts which all support, as
best hypothesis, the notion that the NSA is grabbing as much as
it can, as fast as it can.  One  be a fool to ignore the
pattern of facts and conclude that they were random...

And we know the government is violent -- even against children as
recent events prove.  Judge William Sessions is a disgrace
but a solemn warning to  who ignore the web of evidence
that our government institutions have in  contempt for our
civil rights.

And of course we have to err somewhat on the excessive side of
caution because that does much less harm than erring on the
reckless side. As member of the crew of the USS Liberty might aver.

I might suggest, , that you read Kahn's Codebreakers and
Bamford's Puzzle Palace and come back with some more facts to
support your sheepish acquiescence to authority.

Imagine if this were available during the 1992 elections; instead of
clumsily searching through the Clinton passport file, they could have 
just done a "voice-grep" (as someone stated earlier) on his telephone
conversations for the last 10 years.

I'm not a lawyer and I  even play one on TV, but intuitively 's
something wrong with having one's words archived for possible future
use against you.  This possibility frightens me more than any of the
talk about the  Chip, right to cryptography, etc.

	The  standard *is* the first step toward outlawing other
strong encryption standards.  If the government didn't intend to outlaw
other forms of encryption, than  is just a big waste of time and money.
Why, you ask?  Because anyone who is transferring data that any government
agency could use against him/her  be a total fool to use the 
system..So why add the backdoor-key if all lawbreakers will use alternate
encryption methods? Because they assume they can just do away with everything
else.
	I, for one, am planning on boycotting any equipment that contains
 technology.

As one of the happily sleeping people, I  just like to ask this->
aren't people just slightly overreacting to this?  Or are we all of a
sudden going to draw parallels to Nazi Germany and Communist Russia?

The point of the matter is that; yes this is a serious problem.  But it is
not the end of the world.  Guess what?  We're doing something now you
can't do in a Communist country or Nazi Germany.  We're complaining about
it, (or rather, you're complaining about it) and nobody is shooting at us.  

(Or, rather, if they're shooting at me, they have real bad aim.  (:-) )

GUESS WHAT PEOPLE?  You live in one of the few countries in the world
where a person can complain without getting shot at.  

People are always complaining that somebody did this wrong, or somebody
did that wrong, or whatever.  Sit down and figure out two things:

1)  What have they done right?
2)  How much worse can it get?

And you'll find that you and I, are pretty damn lucky.

So let's talk about it, get some action going, decide what's going on. 
But let's not overreact!

Generally, an  has influence in proportion to:

	The narrowness of its objectives
	The number of members
	The strength of belief of its members

This is why the pro- and anti-abortion groups are so strong: narrow objectives,
lots of interested members who are real passionate.

For this reason, mixing with the NRA is probably a bad idea.  It diffuses
the interests of both groups.  It may well diminish the Passion Index
of the combined .  It is not clear it  greatly enlarge
the NRA.

So, I believe a new , which may cooperate with NRA where the
two 's interest coincide, is the optimum strategy.

A good vocoder like ours will give you 8000 bits per second locked at
full rate (it's a variable rate voice activity vocoder).  If you want
less quality, cut that to 4000 bps (half rate).  At full rate variable
you could put two full-duplex conversations on a V.32bis modem.  This
requires a DSP or ASICs, though.  An RS-6000 has a CPU that could
probably do it in real-time, because it has the add-and-multiply
instruction and a few other DSP things.

If you want to do speech in real-time you need about 4000 samples a
second (for not very good voice) with your 8 bit samples (ISDN is 8000
8-bit samples a second), which is 32 kbps.  You could do a fast 2:1
compression on that to get it down to 16 kbps, which is just about
V.32bis.  The quality at this point is very bleah, but it  work.
Now add in the time for your encryption method.  You're going to need
sampling hardware, which is no problem on a new Mac, an Amiga.  Or a
PC with a SoundBlaster card (just because they're so popular and cheap
- you could also build a simple ADC).  The problem with the
SoundBlaster is that it doesn't seem to be full duplex - you can't
sample and play backq at the same time, making a two-way conversation
a bit tough.  The special hardware or a more capable sound card may be
required.

The only thing that worries me is that 2:1 compression - the
SoundBlaster can do it automatically in hardware, but other than that
I  have a good feel for how processor intensive it is, so I can't
estimate how fast a PC you'd need.

How are you sure of that?  Weren't  some recent studies that
found corelations between not-yet announced decisions and market changes?

Without getting into the ** *thorny* questions about reverse
engineering and all of that, let me just point out that  already
exist gate arrays and suchlike that have what's known as a security fuse
which can be programmed after you've verified all other programming --
this makes it impossible to read out the programming of the device
(again, ignoring the reverse engineering questions).  Speaking from
experience here: I had to completely reinvent one of my designs some
six or seven years ago when the disk file was zapped, the backups were
all bad, and the devices were unreadable because of the security fuses.
Made me appreciate the value of printouts.  ;-)

So on this point at least 's not so much worry.

But whether or not we can get the chips made reliably and securely is
 secondary to the question of whether use of the chip is itself
likely to be secure, mes.

In  <1993Apr19.182327.3420@guvax.acc.georgetown.edu> denning@guvax.acc.georgetown.edu :
	[Prof. Denning's description of SkipJack mostly omitted]

	CHIP STRUCTURE
	The  Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption
	algorithm called "Skipjack."  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared
	with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16
	for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is
	16 Mbits a second. [...]

	F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips
	N, a 30-bit serial number
	U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted
		 with the chip
	The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then
	fed into the  Chip to produce two values:

  	   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and 
	   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.  

Three questions:
1) It looks like each 64 bits of input gives you 4*64 bits of output:
		E[M;K] = 64 bits
		E[K;U] = E[ 80 bits ] = 128 bits
		E[ E[K;U], N ; F ] = E[ 128 + 30 bits ] = 192 bits
   Do you  need to transmit all 256 bits each time,
   or do you only transmit the 192 bits of wiretap block at the beginning?   
   All 256  be  obnoxious for bandwidth-limited applications
   like cellular phones (or even regular phones over 

2) how do the 4 DES modes interact with the two-part output?
   Do the various feedback modes only apply to the message block,
   or also to the wiretap block?  Or, if the wiretap block is only
   transmitted at the beginning, does it get incorporated into
   everything through feedback modes, but not during ECB mode?

3) Does the  Chip check the wiretap block itself?
   Does the block have to be present at all?
    the receiving chip doesn't know the transmitter's U,
   it presumably can't check the validity of E[K;U], so it's 
   limited to checking the *form* of the wiretap block,
   and maybe checking the serial number for reasonableness
   (unless 's some sort of back-door structure that lets
   it recognize a valid E[K;U].)
   
   In that case, can you replace the wiretap block with a DIFFERENT
   wiretap block, presumably an old valid one to avoid attracting attention?
   (The chip won't do it, so you postprocess the output.)
   Regular people can do one with  own serial number and a dummy key;
   paranoid people can use someone else's serial number.

   On the other hand, if I could  of that solution so easily,
   presumably the NSA could too - have they done something to block it,
   like use message encryption that's  E[M; K,U,N] ?


	Thanks!

What???  This is an incredible statement!  The NSA tried to suppress
public key crypto and RSA, and yet they claim to encourage use of
strong crypto for US citizens.

 you trust a black-box from the NSA versus an "open system" from
elsewhere?

One more time...

    If they released the algorithm, it  be possible for someone
    to come up with an implementation which was identical, but
    lacking an ed key.

    Note that the press announcement mentioned that the algorithm was
     kept secret for security of the key  system.  In this
    case security  "an ed key for EVERY  chip".


    Assuming you believed all that is said about the effective of
    the algorithm, and the  system, which  you buy :

     (a)  Chip from firm A with the ed key
     (b)  Second source chip from reputable firm B with no key
          in government .

      obviously be powerful economic incentives for a second
    source, non ed, vendor.

civil liberties in the USA... It seems that I've even been an optimist
- the things are happening even faster than I expected.... That's
another of the dirty tricks they used to apply on us under the
communist regime - do something secret, THEN tell the people about is
(after the fact, when nothing can be done any more), and of course,
explaining them how much better the situation is now...

In my previous messages I wrote that the Americans  wake up and
fight against the new proposal. Now it seems to me that it is already
too late - it has already happened, the civil liberties have been
violated, no, stollen from the American people,  the most part of
this people has been sleeping happily... :-((( Too sad...

I guess the cryptowranglers read this group too.  But of
course I knew that because it is so easy to do.   is
not a single doubt in my mind that every byte that passes
every significant gateway or 'bone is captured for the
colligation of data about __________?  (Maybe your name is here).

Maybe we  start a newsgroup for the  of encrypted 
posts intended of members of affinity groups with a shared private
key.  For example at the coming up Cypherpunks meeting, a private
key corresponding to that particular meeting could be passed out
by a moderator.  Minutes, followup comments to other participants,
and so on could be posted to the alt.encrypted group for the use
of the people who attended. Communiques intended by the group for
non-attendees could of course just be signed using the private key
but otherwises not encrypted.

Starting a alt.encrypted newsgroup rather than just maintaining
mailing lists is better for several reasons.  First, it  be
easier to archive for people who might join a group "late" and
who might like to easily read earlier posts; second, traffic analysis
to know exactly to whom an affinity message is directed  be foiled;
three, a newsgroup is much more public and  serve to publicize

We could send a copy of alt.encrypted directly to Judge William
Sessions or Admiral Studeman to save them the time of having it
collected for them.

    Of course, nothing prevents you from buying a new lock with cash
and installing it yourself. Even modifying the core to match some
arbitrary key is not difficult to do at home. I once knew someone who
had fixed his locks in this way - his house, office and cars all took
the same key (which he took GOOD care of :-)

    Very bad (yours, that is). Have you ever had a safety deposit box?
They work on a two-key system. The bank clerk has one, and you have
the other (they are different keys). The bank does NOT keep a copy of
your key. If you lose it, they have to drill out the lock, and replace
the door. This is a time consuming and expensive process (which they
will be happy to charge to your account :-).

     This process is exactly analogous to having a private key which
is NOT in a  system, and the state having to crack your cipher
to get the data.

     Please do not use false analogies.

Hmmm, this gave me an interesting idea.  How about this argument:

1)  Second Amendment gives us the right to keep and bear arms.

2)  Strong cryptography is "arms", according to the U.S. government (that's
    why it's so hard to export).

Theore, we have a constituitional right to strong cryptography!  
Q.E.D.

However, it's likely to be as hard or harder to exercise this right as it
is getting to exercise the other rights that the government is slowly
restricting.  Maybe the NRA __ be the best existing ?
(Although I  a new one might be better, but perhaps  take too long
to start up.  I  certainly join.)

  If the device is designed to use the key that's registered with the Feds,
I  see how you -can- feed it a different key.  If the user can change
the key to any of the 2^80 possibilities, the main reason for regarding
this proposal as unacceptable disappears.

I hope  is something I  understand about this system, but can
someone tell me how  chips are going to be manufactured  maintaining
each half key under total control of the separate  agencies? 
both halfs of the key have to come together (in some form) at the time
the chip is constructed?

Or is it built like a fusable prom, with the chip  sent to the 1st
 agency to program its 1/2 key, then the 2nd agency to program its
1/2 key (but who invents the safeguards that prevent the 2nd agency from
reading the information already programmed by the 1st)?

This isn't intended to be a flame or anything, I am just  curious
how to manufacture  things   maintaining the key 
security without simply saying "trust the manufacturer, they won't look".

Now why  anyone "post" anything encrypted? Encryption is only of 
use between persons who know how to decrypt the data.

And why  I care what other people look at? 

What does concern me is the continued erosion of my constitutional
rights. ( Amendments I, II, IV, and V to note a few. )

I was responding to another person (Tarl Neustaedter) who held that the
EFF wasn't the best  to fight for crytography rights  the
EFF also supports the right to distribute pornography over the internet,
something some Crypto people might object to. In other words, he's
implying that  are people who will protect any speech, just  as long
as it is encrypted.

  Agreed.  This is like the Bay of Pigs fiasco (planned by the Eisenhower

  To be sure, hen it all went down, Kennedy was at least man enough to take

I must protest your "...in a Communist country". How do you know?
 haven't been any, and are unlikely to ever be any. In some Socialist
dictatorships, you can't, whilst in some socialist democracies
(such as France or Australia)
you can. Of course, some people may disagree about France & Australia

In some circumstances. I was at a public meeting last night (in the USA), where
a protester, who was very nice and calm, and just said before the
speaker started to beware of his opinions, was forced out of the meeting by
two armed policemen.

 are a lot of things that one cannot do in the USA. You may not
notice them, but as an Australian visitor, I notice them.

Yes, we are lucky at the moment. I hope that is  true in

I hope  are some silicon jocks on the committee who can follow
the algorithm through to hardware.   I doubt the NSA  pull
any monkey business on this point -- they have to expect that the
chip will be reverse-engineered sooner or later -- it's an obvious
opportunity to introduce additional holes.

I  a new   be a much better idea, as the NRA

for others.

The NRA is successful because (among a number of things), on the drop of
a hat, they can get a congresspersons office flooded with postcards,
faxes and phone calls.  Certainly, with our way-cool Internet powers of
, we can act in the same way, if such action is appropriate.

As long as we are kept informed of events, anyone on this bboard can make
a call to action.  Hopefully, we're a strong enough community to act on
 calls.  I realize this is a little optomistic, and I'm glad EFF is
working in the loop on  issues, but  underestimate the
potential of the net for political action.

   That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something
   they can get caught at.  And key size is one of the things that can be
   verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the
   chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the
   output.  We already know what ** happen -- about half the output
   bits  vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.

   If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that
   some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that
   they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,
   DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output
   change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I  
   NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.

Consider a cryptosytem that starts out by XORing bits 23 and 47, and
not using either of  bits except through this XOR. This system
makes early use of every bit. but an exhaustive key search  now
only have 2^79 keys to search. Your test by varying single key bits
n't turn up anything interesting.

   Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see
   the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased
   subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.

The algorithm I suggest above  stick out like a sore thumb, but
I'm sure I could design a system with a more subtle key redundancy
which was well-hidden, but   make an exhaustive key search
take far less than 2^80 encryptions. I  believe your claim that
the real keysize can be verified externally.

As far as I know ISDN (call it Swissnet here, and it's  plugged in) it's
8 bit 8000Hz (gives you one channel of 64kBit/sec) I guess you  not go
below a sampling rate of 6000 Hz if you want to have same quality as on an
analog-line. Anybody knows compression-algorithms & -factors for voice ?

   As promised, I spoke today with the company mentioned in a Washington
Times  about the  chip announcement. The name of the company
is Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end
of this message on how to contact them).

   Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that
we are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications
brought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.

   His belief is that AT&T was made known of the  well before the
rest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are:

 - A company of AT&T's size could never be able to make a decision to use
   the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced.

 - Months ago they proposed using  own chip for AT&T's secure telephone
   devices. AT&T basically blew them off as  not interested at all.
   This stuck them as strange, until now...


   Also I spoke with Art Melnick,  cryptographer, he expressed several
concerns over the new  Chip:

  - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.

  - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto
    system is lost forever.  keys can end up in the hands of any agency
    of the government.

  - The fact that the ed keys never change  that the algorithm
    is vulnerable over time to an attacker.

  - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that
    it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or
    changing the keys themselves.

  - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and
    money in working on a way to keep this chip from  reversed
    engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very
    difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique
    to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is
    hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.

Additonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about  algorithm. He couldn't tell
me much about  new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet.
However he told me a little:

 - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been
   granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is
   secure.

 - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.
   The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret
   until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate
   the following:

    - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but
      Mr. Melnick stated "Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.")

    - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.

    - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).

    - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that
      it is _adujustable_ and is "More than adequate for security."

    - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and
      can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the  Chip which
      is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I
      consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.

    - The algorithm will accomodate public key  techniques
      such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the
      hardware chip.

    - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars
      for each!! ( will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced
      enough, which probably won't happen]).

    - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm
      and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted
      data into "blocks." This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know
      what the block header is. This program operates at all supported
      RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.

    - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!



Right now the company is afraid that the new  chip will put them out
of business. This is a very real possibility. So they  need help in
stopping the  chip from becoming a standard. If you want to contact
them, they can be reached at..

Note: I am *not* a cable freak, so I might have completely
misunderstood what you said.  Also, my math is frequently noted for
 wrong, so you'll better check the calculations yourself.

I assume that 14.4K  14.4K Bits.  So if we assume one start and
one stopbit, and no protocol overhead, the effective number of bytes
per second is 1.44K.

Let's also assume that you do not want to transmit your speech in
stereo, so that you can send 1,440 samples/sec.  This corresponds to a
Nyquist frequency of 720 Hz, which  be too low, especially if
you  about the 8-bit low quality sound.  Furthermore, your D/A
converter will probably not present you with a signal that has been
cut off at 720 Hz, but will instead alias in all the higher
frequencies.  (Although you can definitely build a filter to overcome
that problem.)

On the other hand, speech  be easily compressible.  For example,
you could form power spectra, or you could simply band-pass filter and
then linearize the fourier transforms.  It won't be CD quality sound,
but it'll be discernible.  The power spectrum method is very good in
that respect.  I have once programmed such a software compressor, and
compression rates of 90% with relative errors due to linearization of
less than 5% were common.  Although I must say that  were musical
sounds, not speech.

Have fun.

But what about second sources for pin-compatible non- algorithm
chips that also have ed keys?  If a "reputable firm" produces a
chip (with ed key) that is a pop-in replacement for the 
chip in my phone, and uses an algorithm that is widely known and evaluated
and "trusted," then what's the problem?

The  is going to be reverse engineered anyway by any 
with sufficient resources (can you say "billions of cocaine dollars?") so
 drug dealers they're so worried about will be slipping through the
cracks.  We law-abiding (non-incredibly-wealthy) citizens, naturally, will
not have this recourse.  But claiming that the algorithm can't be
released to prevent people from using non-key-ed chips is plain
deceitful... analysis of the chip output will provide information on
the necessary headers and whatnot, so the "bad guys" could build chips
using a *different* algorithm and  not   keys.

Or, they could just buy bunches of cheap phones at K-mart every week,
and play Swap-the--Chip with  cellular phone every day.

Preventing black market chips w/non-ed keys IS exactly what they
mean by protecting the security of the key  system.   are
two parts to the security of such a system:
  
    (a) Preventing decruption by unauthorized personel
    (b) Assuring that the gummit can always decrypt 
        traffic when it authorizes itself to do so.

Of course, the ministry of propoganda will do a lot of tallking about
(a) and very little about (b).

The problem with "Let's assume" reasoning is that, taken to the extreme
(and you're close), you arrive at "Let's assume this is perfectly OK."

The assumptions you make are big ones. If the system is  secure, then
why does the government have to keep the algorithm secret?   are plenty
of encryption algorithms that  depend upon nondisclosure to be secure,
so why in the world use one that does?   are reasons, of course, but
I certainly can't  of any honest ones.

Next, you assume we can "trust" the  houses. But the last time I checked,
EVERY SINGLE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT has experienced unauthorized disclosure,
corruption, and even fabrication, of supposedly secure data. The govt is
saying "Yeah, but NOW we're serious, so you can trust us."  Bullcrypt. 

And finally, although you didn't state it explicitly, you implicitly assume
that the warrant mechanism in this country is safe and reasonable. The case
in Ventura County of a man shot and killed by officers serving a deliberately
fraudulant warrant tells me that the govt has a long ways to go on this
score.

Remember that all this is to catch the drug dealers, right?  As others
have pointed out, the current proposal will, if deployed, render truly secure
encryption much more expensive and inconvenient than Uncle Sam's brand.
Who will be able to afford, and be sufficiently motivated, to purchase this
expensive, inconvenient higher protection?  Somebody with lots of extra
cash...

The following is more true than ever:

  "When [strong] encryption is outlawed, only outlaws will have [strong]
encryption."

,

  As an economist, I'm sure you can see the flaws in this logic. If the (naive)
market is flooded with proprietary, but weak, encryption, then truly strong 
encryption will be unable to compete. Suppose the govt had a secret TV broadcast
standard, and then sold TVs below cost. Private industry has a better standard,
but it's not as widespread due to the govt early flooding of the market
with cheap proprietary sets. Even though the industry's technology is better,
the programming is  broadcast to the govt's unduplicatable standard.
Who could compete?

  The other flaw, of course, is that making something voluntary today ensures
that it will be voluntary in the future. I went to renew my CA drivers license
last week and was required not only to give my SSN, but to PRODUCE AN SSN
CARD to veryify the number!  Note that a federal law once said that no state
or local govt could ever require the use of SSNs for drivers license registration
(specifically!).

   I do not trust the govt that says "trust me on this even though we could
have an arrangement that doesn't require your trust."  Something is big
time fishy. If you look more caully, you'll see it.

To me, a larger problem is that once disclosed, your keys could be used
to decrypt any previously recorded conversations. I gather that from this
proposal a warrant  be required to get the keys, but not to collect
conversations! Consider the scenario where an agency collects preemptively
all encrypted conversations for certain people likely to be targets (and
not necessarily "legitimate" targets), then arranges for some unrelated
incident that can trigger a warrant:

   "Your honor, we know that the suspect has received calls from noted 
crime figure Bugsy Butthead [said calls arranged by the agency] and we must 
theore have this warrant to determine whether this suspect, in a
sensitive govt post, is corrupt."

  I suppose that it is conceivable that  are session keys involved
somewhere, but that doesn't seem likely; if  are, why n't the
technical overview mention them when it goes to such details as the number
of bits held by each  authority?

  This scheme is full of holes, and stinks to high heaven.

I  find this a credible argument, for two reasons.  One you have
supplied below: unless I care about entering the USA at any time in the
future (eg. the Taiwanese backyard cloners - who BTW have been known to
decap custom silicon and reproduce it on daughterboards when pirating
high-profit arcade machines and the like - who n't care less), I am not 
going to care much about US confidentiality, am I?  Only people like the
real me, who does care about travelling to various countries for business
reasons, will sit up and follow laws like this, but I  contend that
we're not the main threat.

I also have grave doubts whether an algorythm widely distributed in silicon
could possibly be called "classified."  It's like handing out military
secrets to the whole world in envelopes marked " open me."  I can
imagine several credible defences which could be employed if it came to
a trial.  One  be the stupidity of the government's actions.

>Perhaps some foreign governments or corporations could help us out by
>cracking the system outside the USA.  The US government could probably
>stop importation of clone hardware, but a software implementation
> be practical.

Amusing thought: could they have employed an algorythm which is infeasable
for a fast software implementation, but which is easy in custom hardware?
In DES, the extensive use of permutation tables (trivial in hardware: you
just swap bus ), but relatively slow in software have had a big effect
on the speed difference between hardware and software implementations of
that cipher (indeed, I suspect that Lucifer's designers were well aware that
it  be, and approved.)  Certain algorythms (usually parallel search
algorythms) can be very slow in software, yet can fly in custom hardware.
I have no proof of  employment in  -- it is pure conjecture.  
However, as a software implementation of this cipher is something that its 
designers  have been trying to avoid at all costs, then the inclusion 
of such techniques seems credible.

Hmmm... I also wonder what Intergraph s about the use of the name
"" for this device. :)

I must admit that this point has been running through my mind for most of
the discussion: one the dice are out , it won't be long before someone
decaps it and, after a bit of work, has full details of the 
algorythm.  This isn't trivial to do, but then again, it is not impossibly
difficult either.  Any half way decent VLSI design student  be able
to take a photograph of a technology s/he is familiar with, and given a
description of the input, output, control and supply , figure out 
the function of various subsystems on the die.  Indeed, this is not an
uncommon exercise performed during training (because it makes you 
about design decisions made by other designers.

I could speculate that  chips are going to be manufactured using
"tamperproof" carriers (unlikely - such techniques are *very* expensive
and this thing is supposed to be relatively cheap to produce), or that
 will be some legal or legislative framework to prevent publication
of the algorythm (unlikely - please correct me if I am wrong but aren't 
supposed to be sold internationally?).  I suppose that the most likely
reason the algorythm is remaining secret for the moment is that some idiot
bureaucrat, untrammeled by the realities of the situation, decided that
"well, we  keep it a secret because it is supposed to be secret,
isn't it?"

Just some random thoughts...

This may be the largest single threat to civil liberties yet in my
lifetime.  The US has done some pretty heinous things in the past, 
and we haven't yet recovered from all of them.   certainly seems
to be a historical trend towards less liberty, with occasional
perturbations.

	I  like  claims. Where did they come from? We hear,
practically daily, that the NSA monitors, oh, everything. They can
crack anything. They'd never release a cryptosystem they couldn't crack.

	Where do people get  fascinating facts? 'The Puzzle Palace'?
If you can get it for a buck, 2nd hand, it must be true, eh? I'm pretty
sure the NSA is supposed to, among many other things, provide high-quality
cryptosystems to a variety of places. I  recall reading anywhere
reliable that they're supposed to:

	1) Monitor my phonecalls.
	2) Monitor usenet.
	3) Provide only cryptosystems they can easily crack.
	4) etc etc.

	This is not to say that they **, they might. But you 
know that they do, and you have no evidence that they do, for almost
all values of you. It follows, theore, that for most values of 'you',
your claims about the NSA b on paranoia.

Having read the various "" announcements on the net over the last few 
days and a LOT of uninformed speculation about the chip, its uses,
government plots, etc, I have the following questions.

  1) What does the " chip" actually implement? Just the Skipjack
	cryptographic algorithm? Or does it also implement a "chip to chip"
	communications protocol? If it does implement a communications
	protocol, can it be used as just a "crypt chip" also.

  2) Where can the chip specifications and spec sheets be obtained?

  3) Who may purchase them and under what conditions?

  4) Are  restrictions as to how the chip may be used in a system?

  5) The security of the algorithm and the encrypted communications does
	not appear to require that the "Family key" be a secret. Why is
	it a secret? What happens when the "family key" becomes well known?
	If it's a secret to make traffic analysis more difficult, does
	the "Law enforcement message" contain any random information?
	How much and how random is it?

  6) Can the chip be programmed to reveal the "Unit key"? The chip "serial
	number"? Any of the programming parameters?

I agree with this assessment.  Furthermore, its promotion as
providing greater protection than bare voice is quite true, as far
as it goes.  However, the only way for it to fulfill its stated goal
of letting LE wiretap "terrorists and drug dealers" is to restrict
stronger techniques.  

Wiretap targets presently use strong encryption, weak encryption, or
(the vast majority) no encryption.  The latter two classes can be
tapped.  With weak encryption in every phone, the no-encryption
class is merged into the weak-encryption class.  Will the
introduction of  cause targets presently enjoying strong
privacy to give up on it?  that is, to rely for privacy on a system
expressly designed to deny it to people like them?  I doubt it.  The
mere introduction of this scheme will give the government *nothing*.

The stated goal of preventing the degradation of wiretapping
capabilities can be fulfilled by restriction of domestic
cryptography, and only by this restriction.  "" appears to be
no more than a sop, given to the public to mute any complaints.  We
 find this a grossly inadequate tradeoff, but I fear the public
at large will not care.  I hate to even mention gun control, but
most people seem to  that an `assault weapon' (as the NYT uses
the word) is some sort of automatic weapon, .50 caliber maybe.  Who
wants to have such a thing legal?  Well, people know even less about
cryptology; I suspect that strong cryptography could easily be
labeled "too much secrecy for law-abiding citizens to need".

What they say is opinion, but what they do is what matters, and will
continue unless overturned.  And the s are reluctant to annul
law or regulation, going to some length to decide cases on other
grounds.  Furthermore, Congress can get away with quite a bit.  They
could levy a burdensome tax; this  place enforcement in the
hands of the BATF, who as we've seen you   want on your
case.  They could invoke the Commerce Clause; this seems most
likely.  This clause will get you anywhere  days.  The 18th was
required because the Supreme  ruled a prohibitory statute
unconstitutional.  In 1970 Congress prohibited many drugs, with a
textual nod to the Commerce Clause.  The Controlled Substances
Act of 1970  stands.  I  the government could get away
with it.

Just to make sure everyone is clear on this: "it never has" ers to 
"protects", not "fails to protect"; i.e., in my lifetime I have never seen 
the U.S. government consistently protect the interest of U.S. citizens, 
except by accident.

It  be in a different location, so a directional antenna could
probably lock in on just the one monitor. Failing that, a phased array
could likely seperate the signals. Admittedly, this is expensive, but
so is all the rest of this stuff anyway.

At the company I worked for previously, I received a file that was des encryped
and the person that had sent it, went on vaction.  Rather than wait two weeks
I set up a straight frontal attack with one key at a time.  It only took two(2)
days to crack the file.  No, I  have any faith in DES.

I totally agree.  But how do you propose we take government back?  They
obviously  listen to the people or want the people to know who is
responsibile for what (a person telnetted the site of the  chip
release, to see what the entity '' was, and got a few lists.
BUt when another person tried a bit later, the commands were disabled)
Does not sound like an Administration that wants to have any accountability
or information they  control given to the people.  The secret
development and implimentation of the  Chip decision further
backs that up.  You can bet unaurhorized encryption methods and software
will be considered 'terrorist tools' and also  to civil forfeiture,
along with the systems that are running it.  YOU WATCH, SEE IF I AM WRONG.

The government is not going to be very cooperative about the people taking
it back.  And they have all the resources, unlimited access to the media
for propeganda, and almost all the guns (soon to be ALL the guns if
Clinton's agenda succeeds)...    that do not play ball?  Waco
might be a good example of what to expect...  The warrant (just released)
stated the reason for the raid was the BDs spent a very large sum
for weapons, over an undetermined amount of time.  I  recall
spending a lot of money on guns, etc  illegal ... yet, that is.

Clinton might go down in history as the worst thing to ever happen to
the US of A. ... Now to be known as the 'Peoples Socalist Democratic
Republic of America'  (PSDRA).

Big Brother is LISTENING!!!

Hail Big Brother... (and Sister...?)  only ten years late!!!

Probably cheaper than you .  I'll bet some of my (and yours)
tax dollars become a subsidy for  chips.  If  chips 
sell well, what's to stop the US government from 'giving' them

Because that will make private encryption stick out like a sore thumb
and the government will start to take a sharp interest in everything you
do.

You are so correct - Clinton did not initiate it.  He just cast it in
GRANITE by implimenting, NOT stopping the DECISION.  I also stated in another
post I  give a damn what administration does it, I  find it
totally unacceptable, and whoever impliments it or rams it down our throats
ought to be run out of office.

Also, Bush was not trying to deprive us of our Second Amendment rights.
Clinton is BUSTING HIS BUTT in that regard.  That reveals a total difference
in philosophy.  Clinton appears to support the idea of TOTAL people
control.  Eavesdropping whenever they feel like it, no real security
for the common person, and no ability to defend oneself against illegal
attack, from whatever source.  "Trust us, we will protect (and control)
you... if we  find it inconvenient..."

Clinton has also shown his utter contempt for public disclosure and
accountability, as well.  He had plenty of time to change the policy.

HE DIDN'T.  HE EXPANDED ON IT.

I bet had Bush been in office, you  be in  howling louder
than I.

In fact,  effective encryption makes censorship impossible, they

                     THE  CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY

                               Dorothy Denning

                           Revised, April 21, 1993


INTRODUCTION

On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring
together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program
to provide secure communications  meeting the legitimate needs of
law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption
chip called the " Chip" together with a split-key approach to
ing keys.  Two  agencies are used, and the key parts from
both are needed to reconstruct a key.


CHIP CONTENTS

The  Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block
encryption algorithm called "Skipjack."  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys
(compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling
(compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of
operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic
Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.

Each chip includes the following components:

   the Skipjack encryption algorithm
   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips
   N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is  to change)
   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip

The chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the
"MYK-78."  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They are
implemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about
$30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more.  The price  drop as the
technology is shrunk to .8 micron.


ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP

To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T
telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and
we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure
conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K
with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place
without the  Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can
be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key  method.

Once the session key K is established, the  Chip is used to
encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The
telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two
values:

   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and 
   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , 

which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement
field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U
concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family
key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after
an authorized wiretap has been installed.

The ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver's device using the
session key:

   D[E[M; K]; K] = M .


CHIP PROGRAMMING AND 

All  Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented
Information Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains
a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips
are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at
Mykotronx.

At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key
 agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random
80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random
80-bit value S2.  random values serve as seeds to generate unit
keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a
function of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.
  
To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is
first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.
S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a
64-bit block R1:

        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .

Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and
N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  

        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] 
        R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .

R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The
first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The
rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2
are the key parts that are separately ed with the two 
agencies.

As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are
written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a
file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part
U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third
disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent
2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowing
an 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However, the agent does not
know the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit
key parts.  

The third disk is used to program the chips.  After the chips are
programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents
leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no
information is left behind.
 
The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the
room instead of two.  The first two  provide the seeds S1 and S2,
and the second two (the  agents)  take the disks back to
the  agencies. 

The  agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not
be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or
both may be independent from the government.


LAW ENFORCEMENT USE

When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they
will first take the warrant to the service provider in  to get
access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in
place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the
 Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the
family key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap
has been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is
then sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key  agents, who
return (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed
together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the
session key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will
be accomplished through a special black box decoder.


CAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATION

A successor to the  Chip, called "Capstone" by the government
and "MYK-80" by Mykotronx, has already been developed.  It will include
the Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), the
Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fast
exponentiator, and a randomizer.  A prototoype will be available for
testing on April 22, and the chips are expected to be ready for
delivery in June or July.

Exactly.

But I'll add another observation: if the chip does become a standard,
the algorithm won't _remain_ secret.

Leaving the government with the only remaining option: to make use
of un-ed keys illegal. Which won't begin to bother the terrorists
and child abusers the government is so fond of erring to.

Note that the Federalist papers stress _one_ reason for the right
of citizens to bear arms: to defend themselves _against_ the army.
_Our_ army.

IMHO the _primary_ purpose of private crypto is defend ourselves
_against_ the government. The odd terrorist I'm not worried about;
the goverment damages my quality of life every day.

You seem to be assuming that all arrests are of equal value, and that
the use of wiretaps is spread uniformly among them.

Given this comparatively tiny number of wiretaps, and the associated
difficulty and cost involved (judges, technicians, etc) I expect that
law enforcement reserves the use of wiretaps for the most valuable
cases.   the "value" of an arrest can vary over an enormous range
(eg. jaywalking -> mass murder) I  your $5 million estimate may
be too low by a couple of s of magnitude.

For  of you looking for information on MS-DOS 6.0's
file system compression API:

Today I called Microsoft's DOS 6.0 hotline at (800)228-7007.
They told me that the DOS 6.0 Resource Kit had the specifications
for the compression interface.  The Resource Kit costs $19.95,
plus tax and $5 shipping.

I ed a copy and will post further when I get it and know more
about it.  I am posting now because the  turnaround is 15 
working days.  

If anyone knows for sure where's 's a good
source of info on this API, please speak up.  I am 
slightly skeptical about the Resource Kit's likelihood
of having detailed programming info.

(posted also to sci.crypt,  the API could presumably also
be used for file system encryption.)

       get fooled by exponents 2^80 (possible keys) is not in the
same league with 10^80 (p in the universe).  2^80 < 10^25.
Remember Avagadro's number?   are about that many elementary
p (not molecules) in one mole.  Pretty small universe!  Or if
you can put 5 Gigabytes on one tape, you  need about 10 trillion
tapes (allowing several bytes per entry).   more than all of the
existing magnetic media on the planet, but wait a few years.  (I'm
including existing audio and video cassettes in the total.  Ten
trillion is about 2,000 per person worldwide...  Gives new meaning to
the suspicions of hiden messages.)

Excellent point, and 's a related point I'd like to make.
They'll have to back up  databases themselves, won't they?
How many tape copies will  be, and how secure will the
tapes be?  If they store them off-site, it n't be too
hard to hijack them in transit.  If they're all kept on-site,
one good bomb attack by some group intent on freeing us from
the threat of government snooping will take care of the problem
once and for all.  I can see it now -- "Hi, we're from the
government and we, um, misplaced our copy of your key.  Could
you mail us a copy?"

Could somebody provide an overview of the proposed systems using the
chip?  (Ought to see if ATT has a spec sheet)  Skipjack sounds like a
normal digital encryption algorithm, so the data path will have to be
	voice --> digitize --> compress --> encrypt 
Compression will be necessary to fit the data on the wire, unless
they want to wait for ISDN (that we  be so lucky...).  Feeding
pre-encrypted data into the compressor will cause it to chuckle at
you; you'd have to tap into the guts of the phone and hack either
the compressed data stream, or selected parts of the output stream
before it hits the modem.  Unless you want to pay for two fast
modems on top of the encryption, and just plug the box in between
your phone and the wall.

	After reading the debate over the , I have a few things to
add.

	First, most of the people I know who activly use encryption
privately do not care about most of the issues that surround this debate,
and any questions about what is or is not ok to use in the US. All they
care about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not. That,
after all IS the bottom line. 

	Second, if I look at all the people I know who use any form
of encryption at all, and this group spans people from the morons who
 insist that the DES is a good and secure standard, to people 
looking at trying to improve upon existing strategies, I can not 
of anyone of them who  approve blindly of a strategy that leaves
 methods open to abuse. The  does this, because people make
mistakes by nature, and the US government is made up of people who are
just as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else. 

	Third,  most of the people I know are at least marginaly
familiar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryption
stratigies, I can't see how most of them are going to blindly trust that
someone will not figure out a good way to compromise the  Chip.
That despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it. So, I can 
not see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip.

	Fourth, when it comes to criminal abuse, sure  are many stupid
people out . And yes, some will be open to  caught via the 
built in back door of the  Chip. However, anyone who is going to
do any serious investigation of how best to secure  data is going
to run into that problem pretty damned fast and, I  assume, start
looking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption. 


	If nothing else were avalible, none of this  be an issue. However,
the truth is that most private encryption users that I've ever run into
simply do not give a damn about the legal status of RSA or PGP or anything
else. If it works, they use it. This is not going to change either. I do
not  for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be
slowed down by the advent of the  Chip. It is all to easy to 
convert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is, if anything,
the  Chip just adds another tool to the user.


	The bottom line here is that people will use what works, and
unavoidibly, I'm sure most criminals  rather face an encryption
related charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty
charges in the case of criminals who murder as part of  conspiricy.
	The other thing that has struck me  the advent and wide 
useage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat is
out of the bag (Or if you have an interest in snooping, Pandora's Box
has been opened), and this is not going to change. I've seen a blindness
to this that I've found utterly stunning, and the  Chip, along
with the way it has been presented only confirms this to me to a larger
degree.

Useful?  I find his estimate of the annual value to law enforcement
of $5 million quite useful, if rough (e.g. wiretaps may be
perentially used on otherwise-hard-to-catch criminals, resulting
in an underestimate).  This comes to twenty cents a head over the
U.S. population.  I  find some rigorous numbers on this quite
useful -- it  make for nice slogans: "Your privacy is worth
$0.37", or whatever it turns out to be.

She hasn't.  Dorothy Denning has spent many years earning the

manner is not easily lost.  Her support of the  -- no matter
how unpopular that position may be -- serves far more to enhance the

From Denning:

   the Skipjack encryption algorithm
   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips
   N, a 30-bit serial number
   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip

   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and 
   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.  

Where the session key is K, and is transmitted encrypted in the unit Key U.
Which along with the serial number N is encrypted in the Family key F.

Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential
analysis).

Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the  chip
and its communications channel.  The function of this spoof chip is twofold:
    
	1) Transmit Channel

	    The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with
	    a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number
	    unrecoverable with just the family key

	2) Receive Channel

	    The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number
	    with a secondary keying variable (assuming integrity of the
	    law enforcement block is necessary for local operation -
	    checksums, sequence control, etc.).

This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  It is probable theere is
a known plaintext pattern used as a filler in the block containing N (34 bits
as used in generating U, U1,U2) correctness of the law enforcement block
can be determined with only the family key F.  Whereas, no one has proposed
Federal Agencies be denied F, and because they could recover it themselves,
The correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bits
of N in E[N; F].

The one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above, but the
mutilation could be detected.  A better approach  be to mutilate the
entire law enforcement block.  If it were done with a group encryption scheme
such as DES or (presumably) Skipjack, the chances the law enforcement block
can be recovered are lessened.

What do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the
serial numbers decrypted in a target search?  When digital transmission
becomes widely available,   be a requirement that  protocol
transmissions be used when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks?

One way to avoid notice,  be to spoof protocol information of the block
containing M, as well as spoofing the law enforcement block.

The goal is to use a secure communications scheme, without redress to 
detection or key K interception (contained encrypted within the law
enforcement block).  The data stream is returned to its original state
for use by the  chip (or system) if required, for proper operation.

It is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained within
the  chip, yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for,
requiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before accepting
and decrypting E(M; K);

The spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols, including
on the resulting serial data stream.  Existing  products could
be subborned.  After all, they are high security encryption systems right?

Super encipherment/encryption could allow the chip to be used without
redress to detection of the use of the chip, or disclosure of the serial
number.  Security must be adequate to deny the serial number, which 
not be recoverable by other .  One can see the use of cut outs for
procurring  phones, or once the number of units is high enough,
stealing them.  It  be a mistake on the part of authority, but nice
from a point of privacy, if the serial number N were not associated with
a particular  chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and 
 process.  Hopefully the list of known missing or stolen
 serial numbers N encrypted with F, and the protocols are not 
sufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted  stream.
This could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and or
spatial relationship of the  stream to that of the super encrypted
stream.

Detection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned
scheme.

******************************************************************************

If you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own, and use
them in a codebook sustitution with your own, where they point to a valid
law enforcement block stored in a library utilizing a session key matching
the remainder of the transmission, you could simply out and out lie, yet
deliver to monitoring and/or hostile forces a seemingly valid law enforcement
block.    captured law enforcement blocks  be used as authenticators,
such as in a manually keyed encryption system.  Fending this off  require
escalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission.

The M code stream  might be independently attacked based on knowledge of
 chip protocols as revealed plaintext.  This could be invalidated
by changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the  M stream
and the actual transmitted stream, under the control of a secure key
generator synchronized between endpoints.

The useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited
based on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission
interception.  You  need a large number of them, but, hey 's
supposed to be millions of  things, right?  Adding time stamps to
the encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical, who wants
an encryption chip with a real time clock?

I just had the thought, that you could capture your own law enforcement blocks
for session keys K that you will not use in actual transmissions as
the session key authenticators.  The proviso that you  mind your own
serial number  discovered.

d. denning just sent out further information of a new version of the 
chip.	If a hash function were to be embedded in a  M transmission
block lecting the law enforcement block, it better not fall on 64 bit block
boundaries.  If it were a recognizeable datum, you could lie with it too.

I like the randomizer inclusion in the MYK-80.  I remember reading that
Intel had an approved random noise source on silicon, hence the ability
to put it Inside.

My earlier argument that " will encourage state and local cops 
to commit criminal acts" is largely moot, now that we've learned that 
the FBI will perform the actual tap.  [It will encourage the *FBI* to
commit (even more) criminal acts, but that's not the point here.]

But this gives another avenue of attack on the  proposal.  When
the EFF/ACLU/CPSR FOIA requests are made, they  ask for details
on the bureaucratic and equipment infrastructure that is proposed (or 
even already budgeted) for the FBI to service tapping requests -- for now
and the projected future. 

From  figures, estimate the number of -tap requests the FBI
is expecting.  Publish this figure.  Compare it on a per-capita basis
with the amount of tapping now known or suspected.

Also estimate how expensive it  be for the FBI to install more
-tapping stations, and how rapidly they could be built and
installed ... ie, get the "plus or minus" epsilon for the near future.

Might be a mite disturbing for J. Q. Public to know  things.

And despite all the technical details [BTW, thanks to  who've been
providing them!], we   know 

1) how the tapping requests will be transmitted and authenticated (though
   it isn't too hard to guess a good scheme).

2) how the results will be securely transmitted (Fed Ex the audio tapes?)

3) how privacy will be re-established when an investigation is complete.

I  have the wiretap statute handy.  But here's what the law says
on pen registers.  This is all from Title 18 of the U.S. Code.  Note
how vague S. 3125(a)(1)(B) is....  I haven't had a chance to check
out 50 U.S.C. 1801 yet.

----

18 USC  S. 3121 Pen Registers (as of 4/93)


S. 3121. General prohibition on  pen register  and trap and trace device
use; exception

   (a) In general. Except as provided in this section, no person may
install or use a  pen register  or a trap and trace device without first
obtaining a   under section 3123 of this title or under the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.).

S. 3125.  Emergency  pen register  and trap and trace device
installation

   (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter , any
investigative or law enforcement officer, specially designated by the
Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the Associate Attorney
General, any Assistant Attorney General, any acting Assistant Attorney
General, or any Deputy Assistant Attorney General, or by the principal
prosecuting attorney of any State or subdivision of acting pursuant
to a statute of that State, who reasonably determines that--

   (1) an emergency situation exists that involves--

   (A) immediate danger of death or serious bodily injury to any person;
or

   (B) conspiratorial activities characteristic of organized crime,

   that requires the installation and use of a  pen register  or a trap
and trace device before an  authorizing such installation and use
can, with due diligence, be obtained, and

   (2)  are grounds upon which an  could be entered under this
chapter to authorize such installation and use "may have installed and

3123 of this title."

   (b) In the absence of an authorizing , such use shall
immediately terminate when the information sought is obtained, when the
application for the  is denied or when forty-eight hours have
lapsed  the installation of the  pen register  or trap and trace
device, whichever is earlier.

   (c) The knowing installation or use by any investigative or law

Apart from the storage and search requirements, because the evidence
is inadmissible:  wiretaps require a warrant.  And as soon as one
such case comes to light, all previous cases are likely to be discovered,
and thrown out.   was an  in the NY Times a few months ago
about how many convictions in the state might be invalidated because
they relied on pen registers -- and the  of Appeals ruled that
pen registers were equivalent to wiretaps, and hence required warrants
under New York law.

I agree that notifying your elected officials of your feelings on this
(and any other, for that matter) issue is the way to go.  And by the
way, the phone #s on the list posted the other day were all in Washington
D.C.  --  For most of you, your elected officials will also maintain
a local office in your area code.

When I 'manage' my elected officials, I use  local office #'s
exclusively, and my fax modem and windows-print-capture software are
my tool of choice.  They see my words as I have stated them, rather
than a summary as they  if I called in /voice/ and left a

PGP is not available on the archive site rsa.com.  If it were, it
 be highly amusing,  rsa.com (actually Public Key Partners,
but it's the same entity) is the  holding the patents
which they claim are violated if you actually "make, use or sell" PGP.
I believe  patents also apply in Canada, but I'm not a patent
lawyer or anything.

 is no such thing as freely redistributable code for RSA which
can be used in North America without legal entanglements.  You may
wish to consider RSA, however, which *is* available from the FTP
site rsa.com in /rsa but probably doesn't meet your definition of
"freely redistributable" (it's readily available in source, in C, and
does RSA, MD5, etc. and comes with a license allowing noncommercial
use.  Like any other strong crypto software, it's not exportable
legally.  It can be modified with permission from RSADSI, which a
number of people have received in the past.)  For reasons that aren't
entirely clear to me, RSA says that only U.S. people  take
RSA from its server, although  aren't ITAR issues regarding
Canada.  The   site (.msu.edu) has RSA in its
, and is OK for Canadians.

 it be interesting to find an answer to  questions ?

First question: When will the LawEnforcmentField be transmitted, and how
does the remote  Chip handle it? Is it transmitted periodically
in the stream of encrypted blocks, or just at the beginning ? Does the
phone at the other side discard  packets via a protocol whatsoever,
or tries it to turn them into voice-output ? (Which  not be disturbing)

Second question: Why!?!? Why is such a strange procedure used, and not
a real RNG ? This turns  S1,S2 in a kind of bottleneck for system-
security.

So no (technical) provision will be taken to place a 'timeout' on 
warrants? This  be a unique possibility to realize such a technical
restriction, by letting the -agencies perform the decoding of the
session key. Just take modem- instead of secure fax. Is this such
a bad idea ?

Wow! (How does the randomizer work?) Are the SHA (and Key exchange) secret,
or publicly known ? Key-Exchange is DH, I guess ?

It seems that  who are opposed to this chip shall have a tough time,
your government realy  to act. :-(

	Hate to mess up your point, but it is incredibly easy to learn how
to make a nuclear weapon.  The hard part is getting the radioactives to
put in it.  Have you ever read Tom Clancy's _The Sum of All Fears_?  It
describes in great detail how a Palestinian terrorist group constructed a
nuclear bomb using stolen (actually found) plutonium, with some help from
an East German nuclear physicist.  For some non fiction, read Tom Clancy's
 _Five Minutes Till Midnight_.  It shows how a terrorist group could
construct a nuke using Neptunium, a low grade radioactive waste product
dumped in toxic waste sites and forgotten about.  He also claims information
on constructing a nuke is easily found in any large library.  Sounds
kind of scary, doesn't it? :-(

Assume in this case the usual canard-adversary of narcotraficantes.  They
probably have more cash than the KGB did, and they're probably more generous
at handing it out.  It will be easier than ever to find or cultivate Walkers
and Pollards for the keys, and it will be easy enough to find someone to
reverse-engineer the chip (unless the tamper proofing is damned clever and
effective).

Gee. Say they feed the 80-bit key through Snefru-8 and take the first 60
bits of the result, then use  60 bits as the real key. How do you
figure out that each key is one of 2^20 ``equal'' keys? You can try a
birthday attack, but if the key can be changed only once a second then
you will need several lifetimes to get reliable statistics. Somehow I
  you could catch the NSA at this sort of skulduggery.

They may collect the data, but making sense of it is another matter.

On sci.crypt I'm a graduate CS major (with strong math background) and
experienced programmer taking a cryptology course.  (<< keyword for
alleged NSA filters).

On sci.skeptic I'm an ex-physics major who's a new-age flake, talking
about silly things like how a person's expectations colors what he
sees.

On talk.religion.newage I'm a physics geek who enjoys squashing
interesting idea with WASP science, although I do write occasional
posts showing a minimal knowledge of Zen, mythology, etc.

I could go on, but I'm sure you see my point.  I'm a single person,
but I react differently on different groups (admittedly, in part
because I'm a contrarian you always shouts "but, on the other hand...").
On top of that, I _loath_ certainty and have taken public positions
in the past for no reason other than to challenge "conventional wisdom".
I wish them luck in figuring out who "I" am based on that information.

(They can probably figure out I'm liberal, with a technical degree
but humanistic interests, from a common thread throughout my posts.
But that describes a fair portion of the users of Internet).

   That is--you get high quality secure NSA classified technology if you agree

That's the disturbing part - use of other products IS voluntary, for now,
and the press releases talk about the White House's unwillingness to
decide that citizens have a right to good commercial crypto gear,
and about how commercial alternatives will be permitted as long as
they provide key  services.  That's a clear implication that
they're considering banning alternatives.

Additionally, use of real alternatives ISN'T totally legal -
you're not allowed to export  good crypto equipment except to
the government's friends (e.g. the Australian government)
you can only export even BAD crypto equipment with  permission,
and the regulators who control the cellular telephone companies make
sure  are only two competitors, so Joe's Garage Cellular can't
start offering a secure service.

"All" is a *very* big number.  The AT&T Long Distance network has
around 20,000 T3 trunks (45 Mbit/sec), which is on the  of 10**12 bits/sec.
That doesn't even count the amount of traffic in the LOCAL phone companies,
or our long-distance competitors.  It's about 200 Exabytes tapes / second,
which is pretty large even for the NSA :-)

On the other hand, I can easily see them recording the traffic for
"interesting" people, such as dissidents, suspected criminals,
foreign telephone calls, and anybody noticed using encryption.
As Ken Shiriff speculates, recording encrypted traffic will probably
be judged not to be an invasion of privacy pretty soon ....

Just a little nitpicking. Wasn't it the government that required
a standard railway gauge ? Didn't that improve things ?

Please  misunderstand. I'm utter suspicious of this 
chip. Why hold the design TOP SECRET ? Was this a work around the
law that says that any discoveries made by people working for the
government is public domain. ( e.g. NIH Class Library, etc. )
DES has its designs published all over the place and it is considered
fairly strong ( although could be stronger ).

  I suspect that the decisive element in the political battle will be the
FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) factor.
  If the people who  be end users of the Cripple Chip hear of the whole
debate only vaguely -- the government says it's solid; other people in the
field say it's Swiss cheese -- the balance of doubt could shift against the
Feds.  Any attempt to limit other forms of encryption could then be presented
as the government covering its own butt by protecting its poor product from
superior competition.

My MDC cipher (which uses any one-way hash function as a CFB-mode stream
cipher, the current implementation uses MD5) uses a key of up to 2048 bits
(that is, you can use a 1-bit key if you want and copy it over the entire
2048-bit range, or you can use the entire 2048 bits).  Runtime is
independant of key size, the system runs slightly slower than MD5 itself.
I presume RC2 and RC4 use a similar system (or possibly they just hash an
arbitrary-length key down to n bits, maybe 128, using something like MD5).

Just doing a quick reality check here - is this for real or did someone
invent it to provoke a reaction from people?  It sounds more like the
sort of thing you'd have heard, suitably rephrased, from the leader of a 
certain German political party in the 1930's....

I am most embarassed that my irrate, intemperate post is 
circulating.

I have been chided by experts for my behavior.  I now agree with
all of them, although some were no more restrained in 
speech than I was 8)

I have apologized to Robin Hanson.

It's all easy with a DSP. The Olivetti Quaderno, for example [*great* 1kg
subnotebook/palmtop PC -- sorry for the plug, folks, but Olivetti 
seem to be doing a good job marketing it themselves :-)] includes sound
digitisation hardware; they provide vocoders for  DSP which produce
varous bit-rates. 's one which gives pretty acceptable voice
quality at 13Kbit/sec, just right for a V.32bis modem.

 DSP can play and record at the same time, too -- so you n't
need to play "two-way-radio". You can also download code to the DSP
subunit, though you'd need a software development kit for the DSP in 
question [dunno which it is...] if you wanted to produce your own 
vocoder for, say, V.32 speeds.

Maybe 300 such pairs suffice to reconstruct S1 and S2? By such a back-
door (in the encryption algorithm perhaps) it  be possible (for  
the manufacturer) to get the keys of all chips that were programmed in 
one session. This  not, btw, enable anybody else to retrieve the 
keys in the same way because they'll never get a bunch of 300 (N,U) 
pairs with identical S1 and S2. (Note that  have to be constant 
for the whole batch by the very nature of the procedure, i.e., they 
have to be typed in manually by the `random number supplying agents'!)

And I was wondering why they'll always do 300 chips in one session ... 
 the procedure described by Ms Denning imposes high costs on the 
production of every chip (at least three persons for one hour each, 
plus the cost of a laptop finally blown to pieces in a spectacular, 
Hollywood-like bonfire; add travelling expenses, drinks and lighting, 
divide the sum by 300)  won't be a larger demand -- not from the 
private sector anyway. 

And let me mention one other thought that certainly has occurred to all 
the notoriously paranoid people in this group before: Who is going to 
verify that _no_ interested party will perform tempest attacks on the 
vault?? 

Where 's so much smoke and mirrors --  can't be a nice, honest 
fire but something  worth hiding ...

You're right, and I retract the suggestion.  , I wonder.  That
 are only 60 bits of key information , in principle, be
detectable.  Maybe some variant of the tests Rivest et al. did to
demonstrate that DES was probably not a group?  It  make an
interesting paper -- a black-box analysis of a cryptosystem.

Hell, just set up a spark jammer, or some other _very_ electrically-noisy
device. Or build an active Farrady cage around the room, with a "noise"
signal piped into it.   measures will not totally mask the
emissions of your equipment, they will provide sufficient interference to
make remote monitoring a chancy proposition, at best.  is, of course,
the consideration that  measures may (and almost cretainly will)
cause a certain amount of interference in your own systems. It's a matter
of balancing security versus convenience.

The recent discussion in this news group suggests that a key search attack  
against DES is quite feasible now. But normally DES is applied in CBC or CFB  
mode where one chooses a random init vector of 8 bytes. Questions:

 - Makes it sense to handle the init vector as an additional key? Then we have  
a 56 + 64 = 120 bit key.
 
 - If yes: Is anything known about the security of this key scheme? Can we  
break it faster than by exhaustive search through the 120 bit key space?

Mr. Ward, before you start blathering about your skill "interpreting"
the Constitution, it might be helpful to learn to read.  After a review
with a high school English teacher emphasizing participial phrases, you
might start with the Second Amendment, and follow it up with:

 97th Congress, 2nd Session, Committee Print, *The Right To Keep and
 Bear Arms*, of the Subcomittee on the Constitution of the Committee on
 the Judiciary, United States Senate, 97th Congress, Second Session,
 February, 1982.  GPO No. 88-618-O

This authoritative, heavily researched and annotated document clearly
turns your "interpretation" into specious claptrap, which is a polite
way of saying utter bullshit.  In spite of your false assertion to the
contrary, the Second Amendment DOES protect the right of the individual
citizen, in his capacity as an individual, to keep and bear arms.

And, Mr. Holland, IMHO, blatantly and harmfully false information,
asserted as fact and globally distributed, deserves globally
distributed rebuttal in the forum in which it is posted.

(And besides, this site doesn't carry t.p.g...:-)

If "I forgot" doesn't have as much credibility as you'd like, consider
this alternative.  Somewhere on the hard disk, duplicated a few times,
keep a 128-bit random number.  When the 128-bit digest of your
passphrase is computed, it is XORred with the random number before 
used as the key for your hard disk.  Writing random junk over the random
numbers makes the hard disk unreadable by anyone.

Now, if you were merely to *claim* that you have written random junk
over the XOR key, no-one  be able to tell whether or not you were
telling the truth.  This is (a) perjury, and (b) vunerable to
rubber-hose cryptography, but otherwise effective.

IMHO, encryption is (also) protected under the SECOND amendment of
the Constitution of the United States.

Privacy has ALWAYS been something that has the effect of restricting
out ability to prosecute criminals.  We are supposed to have the
presumption of innocence.

I have the right to pull the curtains over my windows and close my
door, and the police may not come in.  If I perform a crim in my home,
they will have to find out by  other than simply looking.

Encryption is to my data as the window curtains are to my home.
Simple enough?

I seriously doubt that the NSA s that privacy and surveillance are
compatible.  I doubt of any smart person in any other agency s
so, either.  The PROBLEM is that they simply hold PRIVACY to be of no
value at all.

In this giant bally-ho over this  chip I noticed a rather
disturbing trend in some of the E-mail and posts I've tossing back and
forth.  

Somebody asked me what was wrong about overreacting in cases such as this.

The reason is very simple:  How many people do you want to die in a riot? 
In a new Civil War? 

Everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it, and I'm worried
that people are going to reach for  hammers and rifles before  pens
and paper.  

Can people work within the system before trying to break it?  Examine your
history books, and find out how many armed revolutions led to Democratic
(or Democratic style) governments.  I  you'll only find one in over
five thousand years of written history.

That's not very good odds.  

Somebody once said something like: "Armed Violence is meant only to be
used in response to an armed attack.  It is not meant to be used in
agression.  This is the difference between self-defence and murder."

Let's try to avoid killing things, eh?  's enough blood shed in the
world, without adding a couple of riots, Civil Wars, etc.

I'm probably overreacting.  But what I've read scared me a lot.  I 
want my children growing up in a War Zone.

We've got a tempest receiver in the lab here, and 's no difficulty in
picking up individual monitors.  engineering tolerances are slack enough
that they tend to radiate on different frequencies. Even where they overlap, you
can discriminate because they have different line synch frequencies - you can
lock in on one and average the others out.

The signals are weird in any case, with varying polarisations and all sorts
of interactions with the building. Just moving a folded dipole around is also
highly effective as a (randomised)  of switching from one monitor to
another,

First of all, the chip doesn't do that.  It runs at 16 megabits/second,
which is far beyond what you need for voice.  It's obviously intended
for data as well, and on high-speed  at that.

Second -- what advantage is  to doing the processing in the phone?
I  care how fancy that chip is; it's not as fancy as the roomful
of analyzers at Fort Meade running the program they'll have 5 years from
now.  They can't update every  chip that's out .

Third -- if they did do this preprocessing in the chip, it  probably
have a serious effect on recognizability of the voice patterns.  If
nothing else, that  hurt the acceptability of the product.  The
V.32bis modems are just barely fast enough to do a good job on properly-
massaged voice as is; add any more to the mix, and you're completely out
of the ballpark.

  The only theory that makes any sense is that S1 and S2 are either the
same for all chips, or vary among very few possibilities, so that anyone
trying to break the encryption by brute force need only plow through the
possible serial numbers (2^30, about one billion), multiplied by the number
of different S1, S2 combinations.

: It seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications

I  it is unlikely that data like this could be used in .
Currently LEAs can install wiretaps on large numbers of phones, record
calls without listening to them, and then post-facto obtain warrants
and listen to calls after probable cause is established.  But this
strategy n't get the stuff admitted in .  (At least, not
in the near term.)

In other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidence
inadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to
interpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I'd be surprised
that archiving data without consent  be interpreted as anything
but analogous to a wiretap by the s.

Note that that doesn't mean I  it won't be done if technically
feasible.  Just as I'm sure many wiretaps are done now without
warrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future,
start surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause,
decrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation
gets a boost from data that, sadly, won't ever be presented to a jury.

 I'm posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this
archiving scenario to extremes, read "Lacey and his Friends", a
collection of sf stories by  Drake.  The US starts down the
slippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But  worry folks, it's
stored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can
get to it.  And by the way, we'll be installing cameras on all major
streets.  Hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks and
teller machines,  we?

And then we'll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public
places.  Then in some private places.  Then we'll make it a crime ever
to be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy
cubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and
after.  But, see, 's  a right to privacy.  We haven't
curtailed any rights, not .  And just  how much easier it'd
be to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on a
VR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.

And hey, nobody'll be tracking *you* or *me*, no need to be self-conscious.

After all, if you're not doing anything illegal...

Funny, though.   speeding and the radar detector industry became
pretty much a thing of the past, somehow all this didn't elminate all
crime in the story.  And somehow, politicians got exemptions on grounds
of national security, and rich corporations got exemptions for 
execs on grounds of industrial espionage and the preservation of
competition.  And not everybody was exactly happy with the system.  
I can't imagine why.

Sigh... my version of 'rn' asked me whether I  want to send this

You may as well know that all this stuff about the secret source of the
 announcement is because of a silly mistake.  I am the administrator
of csrc.ncsl.nist.gov, alias first.org.  It's a system set up to help out
the needs of FIRST, a Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams, which 
includes a number of world-wide incident response teams such as CERT/CC and
other places in Europe.  As to the VRFY and EXPN commands, they are normally
disabled,  early on we didn't want crackers to find out the names of
incident response folks on our mailing lists.  We had a disk crash several
months ago which required completely rebuilding the O/S files - same old
story, our backups weren't especially helpful.  As you can guess, I didn't
remember to re-disable VRFY and EXPN until I saw people on the net trying to
find out who was behind @csrc...  When I saw people's names posted
here, I felt it was time to clear things up.  So, EXPN and VRFY on csrc have
always been disabled in the past for reasons having nothing to do with 
.

I posted the White House announcements at the request of policy folks here
because csrc also provides Usenet service.  I posted them from an account
called '.'  I also created an alias called '' that contains
the addresses of members of the NIST Computer Security Privacy and Advisory
Board, set up under law of the Computer Security Act of 1987, and addresses
of other individuals not affiliated with NIST but involved in cryptography,
security, and privacy - I believe that  individuals were included on
this list because NIST felt it important to get them the  information
first-hand.

The '' alias is  for the benefit of  named above.  It is 
not a source for information, it was set up solely to monitor any initial
traffic.  Individuals on the list have requested that they continue to get
traffic that is not already duplicated on Usenet.

 you can rightfully say we were a bit disorganized in handling this,
I  ask that people stop speculating about any hidden agendas or motives
of the individuals on the '' alias - I've already apologized to them
for what's happened.  Disabling EXPN and VRFY is an increasingly common
practice (albeit unfriendly to some), and any effect of disabling it again
was unintentional.

Reasonably fancy.

Standard "voice" circuits run at 56kbps inter-exchange in the US.
Theore, you need to achieve 4:1 to get standard voice quality.

If you're willing to give up some quality, you need only 2:1.  This is 
acceptable from a speech standpoint; it will be a little less faithful to
the original, but certainly intelligable.  That's all you  need for
this application.

It  seem that the one fact that the government has overlooked in this
whole fiasco is the economic standpoint.  As others have mentioned, the most
difficulty the  chip faces is an economic one.  Let's face it, the
average consumer doesn't care or know that the  is a bad idea.  If
 is a perceived need for cellular encryption, then the companies will
provide one.  Most likely, a standard will emerge.  But if the  is
too expensive (and $25 a chip is way too much) then they will develope 
own or buy a cheaper one.  I give SCT my full support, and hope the
 chip goes the way of the Beta video tape format.

Also hope they get sued over re-using the name .

	Yes  is, the patent can be classified as secret.  I recently

	that was only declassified in the last couple of years.  
	is of course the problem of enforcing the patent.

(Sorry about double posting, but I forgot something.)

"make, use or sell" in this context have non-standard meanings:

"Make"  making an encrypted message.  "Use" may mean using PGP, or
using an encrypted message.  "Sell"  probably mean selling an
encrypted message.  It is the message created by a "patented" process
incorporated in PGP, which infringes.

Are you sure that the field is in the area you found the antenna
farm?  The tomb ("Ymvos") of Marathon which Herodotus specifies as near
the fighting area is in an area open to the public.

You must be erring to the U.S. army base of "Nea Makri".  It was
built by the U.S. in the same manner as bases all over the world
(W. Germany, Spain, Philippines, Turkey etc.) were built.  I 
it was a telecommunications hub.  Over the recent years U.S. forces
have withdrawn from the base and removed all military equipment.  The
area is currently under the control of the Greek Navy until the all
interested parties (local goverment, central goverment, political parties
agree on what  be done with the land (park, recreation area,
real-estate.)

(This has nothing to do with cryptography, security and the EFF; I have
redirected followups to soc.culture.greek)

The patents  apply in Canada.  I  the free trade agreement may
provide for recognition of new patents, but not old ones.

        the law requires that wiretaps be requested by the Executive
Branch and approved by the Judicial Branch, it seems clear that one
of the key registering bodies  be under the control of the
Judicial Branch.  I suggest the Supreme , or, regionally, the
s of Appeal.  More specifically, the offices of  Clerks.

       s already operate substantial record-keeping operations.  Some
of  records are confidential.  So the concept of a  holding
information in confidence in accordance with law has longstanding legal 
precedents.  The judiciary is more immune to pressure from the executive
branch than any executive branch agency or contractor can be.  So judicial
control of keys is appropriate.

       For the other half of the key, I suggest a unit of Congress, the
General Accounting Office.  The GAO is Congress's staff unit for keeping
tabs on the Executive Branch, and has an excellent reputation.  It's
controlled strictly by Congress; the Executive Branch has no authority
over it.

       With keys split between the Legislative and Judicial branches,
we might have a chance of this system working honestly.  If, of course,
a way can be found to keep the keys from  siphoned off before
they reach the repositories.

       This  not be construed as an endorsement by me of the
whole  concept.  But if we have to have it, splitting control
across all three branches of government might make it work.

In the  "At last! Now you can talk to your computer." in the May

used Hidden Markov Modeling.  This was the statistical method that Markov
developed to predict letter sequences in Pushkin's novel, _Eugene Onegin_.
It was then said that this technique worked so well that the NSA used
it to crack codes.
Does anyone have any  for HMM and how the NSA used it?
Or is this just an extension of the letter frequency tables that we

The average amerikan today seems to  that the government  be
able to eavesdrop on everyone (else).  Opinion polls show that most
people belive the Bill of Rights to grant too much freedom to people,
when it is not identified as such (BTW, if anyone knows of a cite for that,
I'd love to have it).  Not only does this mean that  people are 
willing to give up everyone (else's) rights, they  even know what 
the Bill of Rights actually says.

How can we show the average person (not the average USENET reader) that
people are actually entitiled to  rights?  So many people 
care if the government is taking more and more control of us all, a little 
at a time.  

If  was some sort of awareness of what the government is trying
to do by a majority of the US population... Just  about what
could be accomplished - but  are so many that trust, uningly,
in whatever the media and government tell them.

Well, isn't this just a hoot! :)  All I read on this group is a bunch
of ppl fearing the misuses of information by the big bad evil govt.
This just happens to be a case of an ordinary-joe-netter, who decided
that he  create and/or distribute some misinformation.  Ppl buy
into BS posts like this (I know, because I forwarded a copy of the
post to my office mate, who turned around and was (although he won't
admit it...sorry Joe!) ready to get in a fight about F-O-R-F-E-I-T-U-R-E!!!)
Please, if we're going to hold our govt (which admittedly has had and
 has its problems) to high standards, then mustn't we follow 
too?  Electronic Freedoms only go so far.

psionic@wam.umd.edu, whose parenthesized name is either an unfortunate
coincidence or casts serious doubt on his bona fides, posts a message in
which he seems willing to take the word of a private firm about which he
knows little that  new encryption algorithm is secure and contains no
trapdoors,  seemingly distrusting that of the government about .

I suppose it depends on how paranoid one wishes to be, but how does the
writer know the firm isn't, for example, an NSA front? For purposes of this
message, how do we know "psionic" isn't?

I  suggest that, but post this to point out that  is a class of
speculation that has no more truth value, without lots of hard evidence,
than the contrary one.

By the way, if "psionic" had said, in lower case letters, that the firm
CLAIMS  was no back door, I'd have no problem with that phrasing.

Taking this at face value (though it seems quite dissonant with much else
that has been published here about brute force DES cracking, unless Russell
was lucky with respect to the key), I'd be very interested in whether the
program Russell used is available? In whether he used a cleartext
recognition algorithm in the program or whether he had to examine each
decryption by hand? In whether he used a known plaintext attack?

He probably  also tell us, given his address, what machine he used--a
desktop, workstation, or super-computer.

Depending on his answer, this could be an appalling development calling into
question both DES and RSA/DES. Dunno about RSA/IDEA.

If any bright programmer with a little idle machine time can crack a single
DES message in a couple of days (assuming no tricks that are
message-specific), then here's my  key, NSA; give me the chip at
once.  :-)

I have an idea as to why the encryption algorithm needs to be keep secret,
and some things that i  it implies. (Of course  could all be
wrong.....) 

from 

                     THE  CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY
                               Dorothy Denning
                           Revised, April 21, 1993

.
.
.

The  Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block
encryption algorithm called "Skipjack."  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys
(compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling
(compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of
operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic
Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.

Each chip includes the following components:

   the Skipjack encryption algorithm
   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips
   N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is  to change)
   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip

.
.
.

ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP

To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T
telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and
we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure
conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K
with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place
without the  Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can
be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key  method.

Once the session key K is established, the  Chip is used to
encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The
telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two
values:

   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and 
   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , 

which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement
field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U
concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family
key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after
an authorized wiretap has been installed.

------------------

suppose i knew how the algorithm worked and knew the N for my chip, but
did not know F, then by cryptanalysis i might be able to determine F from
if law enforcement field 
   E[E[K; U] + N; F]
not knowing N  might make this much harder.

Now suppose that I know F, (either legitimately or not),
If I know K (either because I am involved in the conversation, or I know U
for a party in the conversation), I may now be able to determine U for the
other party.

If I know F I can also defeat the law enforcement field,  I could
make my own, with a different K then the one I am using. Knowing F also
allows traffic analysis to be performed. So I might not know what you are
saying but I could know who you are saying it too.

Now I admit that someone trying to compute U will not have lots of
messages to work from, but  we have no way of knowing that the key
generation method does not (deliberately?) generate weak keys, or for that
matter that the published method is in fact used, perhaps the U's will be
chosen from know weak keys for the system.

Obviously the compromise of F  be a disaster, both to law enforcement
for whom this whole thing is designed, and for the people who believe that
it is giving them security. F is but one number, and I sure that alot of
people (more then 1) know what it is (and if some "panel of experts" is
going to check it over for flaws then many more will know F, forget
grinding chips, bribery and blackmail work just fine.

So, am I wrong? Or are  problems.

That wasn't my point. My point is that your implied position about the "Waco
Massacre" is an assertion cum political position. According to a CNN poll,
about 86% of Americans  the FBI acted properly, and a majority 
they  have done it (the tear gas) a lot sooner. A large majority also
believe the FBI was not at all responsible for the death of the victims,
Koresh was. (Let's avoid the kind of fruitless argument of the sort If A
hadn't X'd, then B might not have Y'd....)

What you call the "Big Brother Chip" is right now a proposal under
discussion, and it is not yet clear that strong crypto is going to be
banned.

Theore neither justifies "any tactic is fair." Thus the statement is
nonsense. It is pernicious, because "any tactic" can lead to damaging
others.

As I see you know from the tone of your reply, 's nothing personal
intended.

This has to be a dictionary attack.  No other attack makes sense.


This  that whoever encrypted the file just typed some password
which was a single dictionary word, and then Russell tried all the
words in the dictionary.  This isn't too implausible, especially if he
was smart and clipped the first plaintext block off the ciphertext (if
the first block doesn't decrypt then obviously the others won't
either).

Assuming one attempt a second, it takes seven hours to try all the
words in /usr/dict/words.   Not real tough.

If you want DES to be secure, you have to use RANDOM KEYS.  You can't
just type your wife's name and  "aha they'll never guess that
one!"

This is an interesting point.  As a VERY COARSE rule of thumb, you can
figure that the final price of a product is 3 to 5 times the Cost Of Goods.
(The exact multiplier depends largely on economies of scale: Products that
sell tens of millions of units/year will be at the low end,  that sell
thousands of units/year will be at the high end.  I suspect cellular phones
are in the middle).  This implies that adding a $25 chip  increase the
cost of the phone by approx $100, or about 25% - 30%.

I   you'll get a lot of consumer support for this.

It's not a question just of who is holding the phone.  It's a question of
what circuit to wiretap in the first place.  If two drug dealers are both
using stolen cellular phones, the FBI doesn't know which  to tap
-- unless of course they're tapping *all* phones (maybe *all* cellular
phones).  If they haven't tapped the connection (ie., at least one end of
the connection) then they  know what key to request.

So, who is Mykotronx, Inc.?  It  be nice to know that they were
not a front company used by an intelligence or other agency of the 
U.S. government.  Trusting the fox to guard the chickens, and all that.
Seems suspicious when the rest of the sources are foxes.

 we are at it, the chip design(s)  be examined and verified
against silicon to insure no trap doors or hidden protocols exist in silicon,
regardless of the security level of the encryption algorithm.  It  be a 
shame if some three letter agency had the ability to interrogate my chip, when
all I'd know is that someone rang, and when I attempted to go off hook the
line went dead.  Could be even worse if the chip were intended to connect
directly to a modem.

The design examination  be done to the gate level.  Does anyone have
a good idea how to tell if  is a piggyback design on silicon?  The model
 be extra logic sharing pins with the advertised function.  Tip offs
 be circuitry that  ignore incoming data if formats or sequence
is not right.  I can  of only two ways an output pin could be used,
and its possible that might be noticed, but could be edited from the netlist.
I  the silicon itself needs to be investigated.  Imagine a design
done in two layer metalization, yet finding a third layer under the
microscope.  

The government is asking for a lot of blind trust:  the encryption algorithm, 
operating protocols, the agency having physical control of the devices, the 
silicon implementation.  I'd feel like keeping one hand on my wallet.

               WIRETAP CHIP BE COST-EFFECTIVE?

                        by Robin Hanson
                     Draft, April 21, 1993

  SUMMARY: Compared to an average monthly phone bill of sixty dollars,
  wiretaps are only worth two cents a month to police.  So the
  proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs by less than one part 
  in three thousand to be cost-effective. 

BACKGROUND

Until now, phones have happened to allow the existence of "wiretaps",
detectors which could pick up conversations on a phone line.  And over
time, law enforcement agencies have come to rely on this capability to
aid in criminal investigations.  However, powerful new encryption
technologies threaten this status quo, by making possible truly
private communication.  A small chip in each phone could soon make it
literally impossible to overhear a conversation without physical
microphones at either end.

In  to preserve the ability of law enforcement agencies to tap
phone conversations, the U.S. government announced on April 16, 1993
that it had developed and begun manufacturing a special "wiretap" chip
to be placed in future phones, instead of the total privacy chips
which have been under private development.  The same day, AT&T
announced it  use  chips "in all its secure telephone
products".

Each chip  be created under government supervision, when it 
be given a fixed indentifier and encryption key.  Periodically during
each conversation, the chip  broadcast its identifier and other
info in a special "law enforcement block".  Law enforcement officers
with a   could then obtain the key corresponding to the
indentifier from special trust agencies, and could by listen in
on any future or previously recorded conversations on that phone.

To date, most concerns voiced about this plan have been about its
security.  The government won't disclose the encryption algorithm, and
many suspect the government will not limit its access in the way it
has claimed.  The track record of previous governments does not
inspire confidence on this point [1].

However, this paper will neglect  concerns, and ask instead
whether this new wiretap chip is a cost-effective tool for police
investigation.  That is, which is a cheaper way for society to
investigate crime: force phone communications to support wiretaps, or
give police agencies more money to investigate crimes in other ways?
Or to put it another way,  police agencies be willing to pay for
each wiretap, if they had to pay  share of the full social cost
of forcing phones to support wiretaps?

To start to answer this question, we might compare the current
benefits wiretaps provide to law enforcement agencies with projected
costs of implementing the new wiretap chip plan.  And  current
benefits are easier to estimate, we begin .

WIRETAP BENEFITS

1990 is the latest year for which wiretap statistics are available
[2].  In that year, 872 wiretap installations were requested, and no
requests were denied.  (This figure does not include wiretaps obtained
with the consent of a party to the conversation.)  2057 arrests
resulted from wiretaps started the same year, 1486 arrests came from
wiretaps in previous years, and 55% of arrests led to convictions.
76% of the wiretaps were for phones (vs pagers, email, etc.), 60% were
regarding drug offenses, and 40% were requested by federal
authorities.  Each wiretap installation heard an average of 1487
calls, 22% of them incriminating, among 131 people, and cost an
average of $45,125 (extrapolating from the 794 installations
reporting costs), mostly for labor.

Thus a total of about $40 Million was spent on wiretaps, to obtain
about 4000 arrests, at $10,000 per arrest.  Thus  arrests are at
least four times more expensive than the $2500 per arrest figure one
gets by dividing the $28 Billion spent by all police nationally by the
total 11 Million non-traffic arrests [3].  Thus the $30 Million per
year spent on phone taps is only one thousanth of the total police
expenditures.  And if we divide this by the 138 Million phone "access"
 in the country [3], we get about 23 cents spent per year per
phone line, or about two cents a month.

In general, we deter a given class of criminals through a combination
of a perceived probability of  caught and convicted, and some
expected punishment level if convicted.  So the social value of having
wiretaps is no more than the amount that we  have to pay to get
the same criminal deterrence through other .  If unable to
wiretap a particular suspect's phone, police might instead use hidden
microphones, or investigate that suspect in other ways.  Or police
might focus on suspects more easily investigated without wiretaps.  Or
we might raise the fine or prison time for certain types of crime.

If we generously assume that  substitutes for wiretaps  be
on average twice as expensive as wiretaps, then the annual social
benefit of phone wiretaps is about equal to the current spending level
of two cents a month per phone line.

WIRETAP COSTS

Let us for the moment optimistically assume that the US government
encryption scheme is as secure as whatever private enterprise 
have offered instead, protecting our conversations from the spying
ears of neighbors, corporations, and governments, both foreign and
domestic.  Even so, the need to support wiretaps  add many
additional costs to build and maintain our communication system.

Extra law enforcement blocks  be added to phone transmissions,
increasing traffic by some unknown percentage.  A special process must
be used to add encryption keys to chips,  securely distributing
 keys to special agencies, which must be funded and monitored.
The chips themselves are designed by a military contractor, whose
design is to remain secret, and are manufactured through a special
process so that the chip becomes nearly impossible to take apart.
(Chips are now offered at the relatively high price of $30 a peice in
lots of 10,000 [4].)  Private encryption systems not supporting
wiretaps  require none of  extra costs.

Perhaps most important, government degree  at least partially
replace private marketplace evolution of standards for how voice is to
be represented, encrypted, and exchanged in our future phones.  It is
widely believed that governments are less efficient than private
enterprise in procuring products and standards, though they may perhaps
perform a useful brokering role when we choose between competing private
standards.  How much less efficient is a matter of debate, some say
they pay twice as much,  others might say only 10% more.    

Currently, a total of $96 Billion is spent as operating expenses of
U.S. phone companies [3], which comes out to about $60 per month per
access line.  If we compare this to the wiretap value of two cents per
month, we see that if wiretaps raise average operating costs by even
as much as one part in 3000, then wiretaps are not cost effective!
And this doesn't even include extra costs phone owners pay because
 encryption chips are more expensive.  Of course most phones
n't have encryption chips for a , but the wiretap benefit
per phone is  the same, so this argument  applies.

CONCLUSION

Given this dramatic difference between the total cost of running the
phone system and the value of wiretaps, we can justify only the
slightest modification of the phone system to accommodate wiretaps.
When the only modification required was to allow investigators in to
attach clips to phone wires, wiretap support may have been reasonable.
But when we consider substantial modification, the burden of proof is
clearly on  proposing such modification to show that the costs
  be less than the benefits.  

If consensus cannot be obtain on this cost/benefit estimate, a
compromise might be to tax phones which do not support wiretaps at a
rate of say five cents per month, a tax payable to police agencies
nationwide to compensate them for  loss of wiretap abilities.

How about half a friend?  The Motorola Codex preliminary V.Fast modem
(which you can by right now) does 24.4 kbps (raw) over standard phone
.  28.8 kbps is what is usually claimed for the "final" v.fast,
but you can't go out and buy that right now, the standard isn't done yet.

Again, voice can be compressed quite well down to 4000 or 8000 bps
depending on how good you want it to be, but that requires a DSP or a
special ASIC to do in real-time.

Hello. I am the  Sternlight keeper of the FAQ. Unfortuantely I cannot
find it at the present time.

From the original FAQ:

Question: Does anyone take  Sternlight serious?

Fact: No one takes  Sternlight serious. They review his opinions and
in most cases immediately discard them or jerk them over to
alt.fan.-sternlight which actually  be alt.flame.-sternlight.

A photograph of  Sternlight for the curious:

Question: Why does  continue to relate mis statements regarding
encryption and other topics?

Fact:  Sternlight has a chemical imbalance of the right side of his
brain.

Maybe so, but it's quite common.  are millions of Macintosh users who
have no idea what's in Apple's patented ROMs. Many have modems connected.
How do you know all your business secrets aren't  stolen? Answer:
1. Because you trust Apple;
2. Because if any such attempt, however sophicsticated, came out, it 
destroy Apple's credibility forever.

In the  case, a representative body of experts is going to be allowed
to audit it, and we'll have assurances (maybe even from the President) that
other than the ed keys  are no back doors.  some may not
have confidence in that (I am not among them), it's a lot more assurance
than we get for many things we routinely trust in everyday life.

   Taking this at face value (though it seems quite dissonant with
   much else that has been published here about brute force DES
   cracking, unless Russell was lucky with respect to the key), I'd be
   very interested in whether the program Russell used is available?

key search is very practical in many real situations  people use
such stupid keys on the average.  password crackers know this well.

   Depending on his answer, this could be an appalling development
   calling into question both DES and RSA/DES.

not .  in fact, public key based communication systems very
often pick keys automatically which are much better than passwords or
pass phrases.

   If any bright programmer with a little idle machine time can crack
   a single DES message in a couple of days (assuming no tricks that
   are message-specific),

if a person picked the password or pass phrase, then the key search is
pretty straightforward.  in running english text, the average content
of a single word is about 8 bits.  in pass phrases, this may increase
to 10 bits or so.  searching 30bit spaces is semi-practical even in
software and searching 40bit spaces isn't outrageous to imagine with
hardware assists of moderate size.

It also falls within the purview of the ACLU, but that doesn't mean
the ACLU (or the EFF)  be the most effective instrument to 
"win the hearts and minds" in favor of access to cryptography. 

It's precisely slogans like "cryptography makes censorship impossible"
which stand to torpedo any attempt to generate a broad consensus in favor
of encryption.  It is not true, and in the context of a public debate it
 be a dangerous red herring.  Advocates of strong crypto had better
prepare themselves to answer such charges in pragmatic terms that laypeople
and politicians can sympathize with. The usual mumblings about
Constitutional amendments are not enough.

Doug Holland claims Tom Clancy has provided the recipe for nuclear bombs.
Clancy himself says he has omitted certain crucial steps. Further, how do we
know Clancy knows, rather than repeating what he's read or been told in the

The Attorney General publishes the number of -ed taps each year.
It isn't enough (around a thousand) for the average non-crook, non-spy to
worry about. In fact, considering any reasonable guess about the number of
big-time crooks and spies around, it may not be enough even for most crooks
and spies to worry about.

's no reason to believe that it will go up with ,  the
number of taps now includes many targets too stupid to use encryption (based
on the playbacks we've heard in  cases).

I believe it is illegal to send any cryptographic code out of the country
without an export license. (Others will correct me if this is inaccurate.)

Dunno if you'd get one for the particular code you have; the only way to
find out is to apply for a license.

Note that you need to distinguish between what is legal to send to Canada if
YOU have such a license, and what is legal to send if you .

Some of the messages here seem to lect the view that the government is
listening in on everything and one will have to hide one's  messages
somehow if non-ed crypto goes away.

A little perspective might be in .

The number of  ed wire taps is pretty low. Law enforcement has to
present pretty good evidence to get even that limited number of
authorizations.

Thus the overwhelming majority of conversations are neither tapped nor
recorded by the government, and for that to happen they have to:
a) Have a pretty good reason, with evidence;
b) Use this sparingly on highest priority "pretty good reasons."

Though the system may be imperfect, it is a long way from the horror stories
some here seem to believe or anticipate.

 you asked, the above is a bit inaccurate. More accurate is that the
government says its solid, other people in the field who might be able to
find out haven't yet done  review of the chip design, and 's been
a lot of wild speculation and guesswork from  with little information
that it might be Swiss cheese.

Far more effective than mass mailing of a standard letter (this is taken
usually to represent one pressure group) is a set of individual letters.

Perhaps Nathaniel Sammons or someone else  like to prepare a set of
"talking points" from which individuals could compose  own letters.

Actually, it's not quite that bad, but it's close.

Look, we (collectively) have the power to throw the bums out, but we
 use it.  We clearly  need to go burning things down, but we
clearly do need to throw at least some of the bums out.
Unfortunately, the bums have learned to target only small groups of
people at a single time, so the masses won't react and throw them out.
Eventually, the masses will react, unless the bums cease 
relentless encroachment on liberty and despoilment of the economy.
The sooner it happens, the less the damages will be.  I  want to
live in a war zone, either -- I want to see the bums thrown out before
they do some *real* damage.

You obviously haven't read the information about the system. The chips
put out serial number infomation into the cypher stream to allow
themselves to be identified. The system does not rely on registering
people as owning particular phone units.

I am against the proposal, but lets be accurate in our objections.

It is said that CELP vocoders can run on the highest speed 486s with
some room to spare -- they turn 64kbit (8 bit samples, 8k samples/sec)
into 4800 baud. However, DSP is hairy, and I have yet to see actual
proof of this in the form of an implementation. I have heard fairly
reliable rumors to the effect that a famous internetworking guru has a
CELP implementation that runs on Sparcstation 1+'s with some room to
spare, but I have not succeeded thus far in getting my hands on a copy
-- the guru in question has a reputation for not releasing code
without having beaten on it for a very very long time first. 

DSP experts are heavily encouraged to try  own hand at this
problem.

So, who is Mykotronx, Inc.?  It  be nice to know that they are
not a front company used by an intelligence or other agency of the 
U.S. government.

 we are at it, the chip design(s)  be examined and verified
against silicon to insure no trap doors or hidden protocols exist in silicon,
regardless of the security level of the encryption algorithm.   is
no proof that the chip won't squeel and role over for someone with the
proper knowledge to interrogate it via the communications link.

The design examination  be done to the gate level.  Also, how does one
verify that what you are looking at is lected in tapeout, or masks?

The silicon  be examined as well, the design in hand (a clean room
publicly defined  chip) can be merged with another design later, or
changed between completion and mask out.   is little proof that what
you are told is in the chip is all that is in the chip.

Put the (verified) masks in , and use them for chip production,
use a third  party for programming the chips. 

The government is asking for a lot of blind trust:  the encryption algorithm, 
operating protocols, the agency having physical control of the devices, the 
silicon implementation.  If the  government is so trustworthy, why 
anything?

Qualcomm had spare cycles in the DSPs for  new CDMA digital
cellular phones. They wanted to put strong crypto into them  they
had the capacity. The government decided to "discourage" them.

, none of this stuff is especially hard. All you need for a true
private phone is an ISDN codec, a vocoder (either a chip or
software), an encryptor (a chip is fine, but software is more than
fast enough), a V.32 or V.32bis modem module, and maybe a
microcontroller to run the whole thing. Its easy to do, its cheap. And
any "normal" company trying to put one out will likely get a visit
from the boys in the dark suits from Washington, just like Qualcomm
did. I suspect that companies like Cylink are tolerated because 
products are too expensive.

However, no law yet stops one from building  private phones, in
spite of the hints the administration has made when discussing the new
"crime bill" and in connection with the /Skipjack Big Brother
chip. Someone out  WILL build a unit to do all this. Better yet,
prehaps someone will produce a package that turns any 486 box with a
sound card into a secure phone.

This won't help if the NSA/FBA axis requires all messages to

Given that certain archival methods have certain key(cleartext) in a file I
used a programatic dictionary attack.  I used the DES library provided with the
system that I was using.  What is to keep anyone from  lucky with a key?

My previous employment has nothing to do with my current address, other than
the fact that the fastest machine in the office was an IBM RISC System/6000 
model 530, with 16 meg of memory.(not a super-computer)

I   this more of a statement of the limitations placed on the key
by the interface(ascii char/no padding), and most programs  bother to
clear off the archival front and backend ID's.

Yes any moderatly bright programmer with a little idle machine time, can
crack most of todays real world encryption.  I sure that you or I could
select a key, and prepare the data in that the decryption will become a 
worst case.  but that is not the real world, and I'm sure that is how any 
agency  start an attack on a message, as you pointed out,  are some 
very good recognition algorithms availible, I'm just not familiar with them.

Perhaps you  talk to the government about that. Or are you a

The implied threat of the illegalization of private crypto, the
not-so-subtle subtext of the  announcement, is what worries me.
I  want my children growing up in a police state.

  The reason I could theoretically trust Apple (though I'm a PC person
myself :-) ) is that Apple has to worry about  customers deserting
them if they screw up badly enough.  The government doesn't have any such
worry; it can change the rules by force to get the outcome it wants.  This
is the ultimate reason why private enterprise is usually more efficient
than government agencies.

	Have the feds shut down the people making Sound Blaster? What
about Apple and NeXT? Apple, NeXT, Sun, and others make systems that
can handle CD-quality audio in and out, and can perform arbitrary
transformation on it in the process of transmitting it across a network
or modem.

	Perhaps 's a market for a portable vocoder. Not a crypto
device, simply an RS232<->voice converter. Make it capable of recording
speech and playing it back simultaneously. It has applications for
multimedia, computing for the handicapped, Internet Talk Radio, IRC,
etc, etc, etc.  It n't be a cryptographic device at all - but I
suppose someone could have it hooked to a 486 laptop with a V.32bis
modem and some crypto software. I'd market the thing with an API for
text-to-speech using simple phonemes and the ability to use speech
samples. And, of course, I'd publish the interface to it so other
folks could write any applications they wanted to talk to the thing.

I just joined this group recently and  do not know much about
cryptography, but a couple things came to mind  reading through
the posts.

1.  Is the  chip going to be exported?  If not, how will
people communicate with other countries?  Will they have to do
that in un-crypt-mode.  Will other encryption techniques be
legal (assuming the government cracks down on using others) when
going overseas, but not within the states?

2.  I've read about authentication systems that use an electronic  
security card that looks like a calculator to create an encrypted
PIN based on the time/date.  The host system has the algorithm
built into it as well so that it can authenticate a user.
Is  some form of encryption technology that  create
keys that are only valid at a certain instant in time?  The 
systems  then allow a "window" of time around this instant
where the key  work.
I realize that this technique  increase the amount of information
needing to be stored because you  need entire algorithms rather
than just keys.  But for smaller scale things it might work.
Could some similar method be used to make the two 80-bit keys that
are issued to police/FBI/etc to tap a phone only usable for one-week
(for instance).  If further surveilance was needed, they  have
to go back to the  service to get another key.  This 
make it useless for local police to database keys they have used.

I assume this is not possible because the receiving phone  need
to be able to decypher the message.  But any thoughts on the ?

Thanks,

That is not true, with chosen plaintext attacks DES keys can be determined

You can obviously shove arbitrary data through your chip......
As for the key, it is stated that the sesion key exchange is external to
the chip, so I can pick my keys too.

I have a couple reasons why I  be more likely to trust this algorithm:
	1. The algorithm will be made totally public, once it is patented.
	2. The keys will NOT be ed.
Of course if either of  is not true, I will not use this new algorithm.
 I have never seen this new algorithm, I have no idea how secure it is
yet.

I can't make any judgements about the algorithm itself yet, but I do notice
that the creators of this algorithm are  more open about how the
thing works, and is willing to make it public, showing that after a bit
of scrutiny, any weaknesses will probably be revealed,  we  know
about .

   I hope  are some silicon jocks on the committee who can follow
   the algorithm through to hardware.   I doubt the NSA  pull
   any monkey business on this point -- they have to expect that the
   chip will be reverse-engineered sooner or later -- it's an obvious
   opportunity to introduce additional holes.

The chip isn't the place to pull the monkey business - you do it in
the key generation, either by having a mathematical backdoor,
or by having the program on the laptop that supposedly generates the
keys also save a copy of S1 and S2 and leak it out somehow,
or by having the program that supposedly puts the official keys
on the chip actually put a *different* key  (VERY hard to detect,
 the  agents have to either trust the NSA laptop or
give each other the S* keys, and they   know the algorithm.)
Or have the chip-burner at the factory make copies of the keys.
Or whatever.

 are chips which perform the voice compression/expansion.  They can't
be expensive, because they exist in many phones connected to PBXs or on the
PBX line cards, as well as in a lot of equipment which compresses
voice-grade circuits to save the cost of long-distance, leased T1s or
satellite circuits.

I can't remember the generic term for  chips.  My impression is that
this was a big deal 10 years ago, but circuits have gotten so cheap that
it isn't done much now.

Right.  People here believe the government is listening in on
everything.  Sure.  If you can't provide an answer, change the
assumptions to something you can deal with.

It's not a matter of the government listening on on everything, it's a
matter of the government listening on anyone they take an interest in.
Say, if you do something heinous like attend a computer meeting at a
mall, the Secret Service decides to go for a warrantless search, and
acquires your name.  It's a matter of any number of possible wiretap
abuses that cryptology makes far less likely, and this chip can
sabotage. 

Par for the course, though.  I predicted that you'd be jumping in in
favor of this.  The reply was that you'd justify anything up to and
including death camps as long as the government backed them and had a
written policy statement.  Perhaps a little extreme, but not much.

   How fast do the fastest modems go?

V.FAST is targeted for about 28kbps; 14.4kbps is ~$500, and 19.2 may
be here soon too.  (Remember to ignore compression figures which make
your modem go faster on compressible data, because voice gets
compressed better than that, and encryption makes further compression impossible.)

   How far can voice be compressed?

The STU-III phones on the market from AT&T, Motorola, and (I forget who else),
give you a choice of 9600, 4800, and 2400 baud.  The 9600 and 4800 are CELP,
and I  the 2400 is some earlier military vocoder stuff.
9600 is decent, 2400 is pretty artificial, anything less is Speak&Spell.
16000 can produce quite adequate sound.  's also some 8 kbps CELP around.
DSPs have made it possible to do all this in real time for cheap.

Old-hand government crypto have trouble adjusting to systems faster
than 9600 baud, because if the voice on the other end sounds good,
you assume the crypto hasn't been turned on yet :-)

Tom Clancy omitted  key steps to try to prevent groups of people from
building a nuclear bomb.  However, he asserts that you can find  key
steps in any  library.  The main point of _Five Minutes To Midnight_
is that it is impossible to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons,
 it has become easy to acquire the knowledge to build one, and fissible
materials are nearly impossible to control.  Read this , or better
yet, run to your library yourself and dig up some stuff on constructing a
nuclear weapon.

 are companies (one in Canada, as I recall) which specialize in
analyzing chips to understand process technology, design rules,
... to understand the probable yield of the assembly line making them,
and theore the probable current cost and possible future cost curves,
given design shrinks, statistical quality control -> better yields, etc.

Taiwanese, Japanese and especially Korean semiconductor manufacturers
have all (korea continues) reverse-engineered foreign chips and
produced the chip.  Taiwan and Japan have signed intellectual
property treaties, and now at least extract the gate/transitor level
design before laying the chip out again.  The koreans 
use mask-level copying, I believe.  At least, they are under a lot
of pressure to pass laws to meet international intellectual property
standards.

All this despite lots of attempts to hide the designs.   are lots
of techniques to do so in both hardware and software design.

For a complex chip,  will be real intellectual effort extracting
the gate design from the transistor design, and the algorithm from
the gate design.  But it won't take two smart guys even 6 months, working
40 hour weeks.  Koreans work 60 or more 8)

By "almost" I mean the differential cryptanalysis attack.  The chosen
plaintext attack requires a detailed analysis of about 2^36 chosen plaintexts
drawn from a total of about 2^47 that need to be run, if I understand the
situation correctly.  This is certainly a "break" under the meaning of the
Act, but does not constitute much less work than the brute force keysearch.

The rest of his  assumes that we can figure out the Skipjack

I am not defending the system, and in fact am offended by the ideas of

However, I also object to opposing it for the wrong reasons,  that
weakens the case against it.

No, it's quite different.  The government  have no percentage in
choosing F to be a weak key,  it's not to  advantage to have
anybody else know it.  The "experts" could thus assume that F is no worse
than anything else during  analysis.  Totally different situation
from unknown S-boxes.  Again, I'm not saying it  be good or
satisfactory for the experts to just be given the raw algorithm without
the rest of the surrounding details regarding the chip and protocols and
so on -- simply that I doubt that they <> be given all the
information.

Now, almost 100 years later, we have the right words for the problem here.

Phone calls are "virtual visits".   experienced in virtual reality
 know from that title that phone calls need to have all the properties
of a walk in the park with your friend -- security from casual overhearing
and easy verification to see if anyone is listening secretively.  As designed,
they fail at that.

..trouble is, telephones were invented a long time ago and people didn't
realize the danger or the concept of virtual reality back then.

's an out for him.  The announcement talked about strong cryptography
I believe.  Specifically:

	nor is the U.S. saying that "every
     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product."

Every vendor claims his product is unbreakable -- so this was sloppy wording.

I am not claiming that we private citizens  have access to the NSA's
best, secret algorithms.  I  want any NSA algorithms, actually.

I'll let them break my pitiful amateur algorithms -- and RSA's.

All I want is what I have already -- the ability and right to invent and use
my own algorithms, share them with my friends and sell them.

     Ever  Craig Rowland posted his piece "New Encryption"
to sci.crypt  has been some discussion of our company,
Secured Communications Technologies, Inc, and on encryption
algorithm, NEA.
     I spoke to Craig at length on 4/21/93 and we covered a lot
of ground.  Some of the information in the posting requires some
clarification, and I  like to answer some of the questions
raised on sci.crypt.
     SCT is a small company based in Silver Spring Maryland.  Our
two main products at this time are a PC based secure
communications program called SECOM and a general purpose
encryption chip which uses the NEA algorithm developed for SECOM.
     SECOM provides an encrypted secure communication link
between two PC's connected over dial up telephone .  It
supports simultaneous bi-directional file transfer and keyboard
to screen "chat".  It has its own proprietary communications
protocol which is tightly integrated to the encryption.  All
though it is a packetized link, the data stream appears to be
continuous because the packet boundaries are hidden.
     When SECOM was initially developed, it was implemented to
use DES encryption.  A business decision was made to seek export
approval for the product because it was perceived that the
overseas market was a large one and provided a good marketing
opportunity.
     We soon found out that we  NEVER be granted general
export approval for anything using DES.  All though the reason
for this was never explicitly stated, it seems to have something
to do with secret government to government agreements which are
 in effect.
     In any event, the decision was made to develop a new and
different algorithm which  take the place of DES.  This was
the reason NEA (New Encryption Algorithm) was born.
     At this time NEA is  held as a trade secret.  The
preliminary work of patenting it has begun, and the plan is to
make it public once the patent process is complete.  All though
one can make certain legal arguments for keeping it an ongoing
secret, I  in the case of an encryption algorithm it is
necessary to let people "shoot at it" over an extended period of
time to prove its worth.
     In  to get export approval for SECOM/NEA, it was
necessary to go through NSA and to reveal to them the details of
the program and algorithm.  This was done only AFTER we had a
finished product to submit.
     Let me state unequivocally that  is NO "back door" to
the program or the algorithm.  Secured Communications
Technologies is a closely held private company and
NSA/FBI/CIA/NIST/WHATEVER has NO financial interest in any way
whatsoever with the company or any of the people involved.
     From a practical business standpoint, we are interested in
selling chips and software (hopefully in large quantities) and a
back door to the encryption, if found out, could destroy our
credibility and our business.
     With the encryption algorithm approved for export, we set
out to talk to a number of potential customers for encryption
products and systems.  We were able to identify several common
threads of functionality requirements.  This led to the design of
a chip with the encryption algorithm "cast in silicon" and
certain other capabilities added so that the chip could fulfill
the broad range of requirements that we identified.
     We are strongly opposed to the /capstone chips.  In a
press release today, our president, Dr. Stephen Bryen stated:

          "It seems as if the government has an unlimited source
     of funds to use to push its new bugged chips on the American
     Public.  But do we not understand how the National Security
     Agency, which is not supposed to be involved in domestic
     spying, can fund the development of a commercial chip
     intended to accommodate U.S. government domestic spying
     activities."

     If they had asked me to put a "back door" in NEA I 
have told them to g__ f____ed.
     Can NSA break NEA?  Or for that matter can they break DES,
RSA, IDEA, Diffy-Hellman, PGP, RC2, RC4, or whatever?  I 
know and probably never will.

I just signed up for this group, so I hope I'm not missing something
in a FAQ, but I'm looking for a good introduction to the mathematics
of encryption -- particularly DES and Public-Key, though others 
be interesting also.  Probably a good library could help me out, but I
thought it might be even easier if I could obtain a nice 
entirely electronically (besides, I have this rather *rational* phobia
of libraries for reasons stemming from this "dissertation" thing
hanging over my head :-)).  
	I have a basic knowledge of mathematics... number-theory is a
bit unfamiliar to me, but I've had a few graduate-level math courses
in some other areas; anyway, I'm not a complete novice to the field.
So probably something aimed at a basic graduate introductory level
 be about right.  Something, anyway, which is more specific than
"a  big prime number is generated to code the message".
	If someone knows of a good text available by ftp (or gopher),
or  like to email me one... please let me know.  I'll probably keep
reading this group; but it  be nice if you  email me at the
same time, so I  miss it.

OK, , I'll provide some evidence. A friend of mine worked for an
electronics manufacturer on with a west-coast office. They routinely sold
equipment to the Japanese. One day, the Japanese started showing up with
discount demands that were amazingly close to the cost to manufacture the
products.

This company routinely sent most of the manufacturing data to the field 
offices. The Japanese had simply intercepted it. So my friend, the computer
systems admin, came up with a solution. He started sending the data out
double-block-encrypted with DES. 

Two days after this new  plan was implemented, the president of
the company got a visit from a pair of government agents. They told him to
"knock it off". The president gave in,  his company did a considerable
business with the federal government.

Now, if the government wasn't monitoring the communications, how  they
even know that the encryption system was installed? Further,  encryp-
tion isn't illegal, and DES certainly isn't, what is the basis of the
government's cease-and-desist demand?

The spooks do whatever they  is necessary, with or without the blessings
of the law. I'll say "no thanks" to , or anything else the government
produces. For the moment, double or triple DES is probably adequate. And when
the line is idle, send random garbage, just to keep 'em busy.

A circut  judge in Illinois once said "When dealing with a government
that seeks continually new and more creative ways to spy on its' citizenry,
one cannot discourage the move to empower the common citizen with the 
to parry this attack on personal privacy."

(Unfortunately the comment was with regard to the banning of radar
detectors....)

The point remains.  More and more I see the government slowly washing
away privacy.  Even unwittingly.  Do you  I will ever live in a
soceity that issues smart cards to citizens at birth?  Do you  I
will live in a soceity that insists I register my crypto keys so they
can keep track of what I'm saying?  Even if  is no evidence of my
guilt?  Do you  I will ever live in a soceity that seeks to meddle
in the affairs of its' citizenry without recourse of any kind?  I'm tired
of it.   is (IMHO) no compromise with an administration that seeks
to implement  proposals under the guise of enhancing privacy.

More than the proposals themselves, I read the language of the press
releases, the obvious deception involved in presenting  pieces to
the public, and I am sickened.  I am revolted.  I am repulsed.

90%, perhaps even 95% of this country could care less about the
 chip, the wiretap bill, the smart card, because they are so
entrapped in the rhetoric of the Clinton Administration.

This saddens and frightens me.

I am a conserveative believe it or not.  A law and  conserveative.
But the move to a centralized authoratarian regime  scares me,
mostly because I know you cant go far wrong underestimating the
intelligence of the American people.  Tell them it's going to keep
them safe from drug dealers and terrorists, and they will let you
put cameras in  home.

Even in the wake of Waco, you find  who support the increasingly
totalatarian moves.

>Somebody once said something like: "Armed Violence is meant only to be

To be quite honest, the way things are going, I'd call it self defense.

Interesting.  Tell us, what happens if I were to say OK, I want to have
something else.  If the law enforcement wants my traffic, they can record
it, then get a search warrant, and get the keys FROM ME, just like they
 the keys to a stout private safe, etc. (Lets say I suspect that
 is a way to trivially crack this at the Fed level, with no warrant,
say for NSA scanning for keywords, etc., and the government has abused
great power in the past...).

So I say "Mr Vendor, I want something different, independent.  I am

you anything secure", or  it be "Sorry, we know which side our
bread is buttered on, we cannot sell except to government people, law
enforcement, and 'special' people...".

What, in your opinion,  be the chances of "sure, we will sell you
this secure system ... be happy to..."

Also, please be so kind as to tell us what the plans are for private
encryption of, say files transferred by modem, or FTP, or data stored
on disk?  SURELY you have a feel for what the administration is planning
for us people on that....  With your rather intimate relationship with
the FBI, NSA, etc. you must CERTAINLY have an idea.  You are surely
not going to say "the people are not to know, until it is too late..."
This IS supposed to be government of the people by the PEOPLE, isn't
it?  That is, the people ARE the government's BOSSES?  The BOSSES
want to know what the *@()#*&(@ is going on here...

You see, I am kind of nervous, because in the last month or so, I have
seen a non-stop stream of ideas coming out of Wash DC that at least
appear VERY STRONGLY to have a common trait to limit privacy (freedom
from Govt eavesdropping), and the ability to defend ourselves against
violent attack (no, 911 is *NOT* good enough for 'common folk', they
arrive only in time to clean up the mess: I  be DEAD if I had to
depend on 911...).   You see, with all that talk about National smart
ID cards, limiting of encryption to 'government approved', denial of
 to effective personal defense (EIGHT bills in congress right now),
it looks an AWFULLY lot like the whole thing is to be able to trace
EVERY ACTIVITY of an individual from cradle to grave.  All it  take
is requiring that National ID card to be used in all transactions...
and with no effective data protection, and with the people suitably
disarmed,   not be a helluva lot they could do about it, now
 ?  All in the name of the War on the Constitu ... er ...
drugs, and of course that catch word 'terrorists'.  What is wrong with
good OLD-FASHIONED POLICE WORK to build a case?  They  want to
have to be burdened to leave the office, it seems...

Please read the Bill of Rights (first ten amendments to the US
Constitution) and tell us how you can reconcile this Big Brother-ish
policy of the Administration (always for a 'crisis' of some kind, isn't
it?) with that Bill of Rights in the context of the people who wrote
it?

Reassure us - please... (or is that no longer regarded as necessary,
seeing as apparantly the people have NO input on this agenda, the
Administration perring to make all the DECISIONS in secret, then
springing it on us...).  Doesn't sound much like ... by the PEOPLE
to me.  I cannot help notice that the congress people involved were
NOT mentioned on the press release.  I find that more than a little
bit curious,  you?  I sure  like to know who to not vote
for come election time...

Yes, I am upset.  I feel you are a part of this, because I recall it
was you that was posting HEAVILY in favor of a very similar idea (could
have been the SAME thing, it was so close) a few months ago...  I
also recall it was not well received.  Apparantly powers-that-be
 didn't care (or were not told, or both).

From what I see,  will ONLY be useful for conversations I 
want the neighborhood kid listening in on.  Any SERIOUS security I 
 I  want to trust it a bit.  Might as well use cleartext.
Certainly corporations  be rather dumb to depend on this for serious
trade-secret data, especially if millions depended on that security.
Given enough money, one could BUY any keys they wanted.  Buy a crooked
judge, and a crooked cop.   Given a few hundred thou, they n't be
hard to find.  So, we end up with only criminals, terrorists, and the
Government with real security, and the ability to eavesdrop.  You know
the first two, if they are serious, ain't going to use this thing for
 communications.  I bet the government won't, either (except perhaps
to  a pizza).

Tell us, will that be prima face evidence of criminal activity,
someone not using the 'government approved' methods?  That just a desire
to have PRIVACY is no longer regarded as a legitimate right of an
unconnected citizen?  Will that be grounds for a fly-through-the-door
raid, and confiscation of all one's equipment, as 'terrorist tools',
using civil forfeiture, so  will be no inconvenient need to
PROVE any wrongdoing on the part of the citizen?

I have yet another question, are we going to see  in all the
public magazines, consisting of soothing text telling us how great
this is, how nice the government is by LETTING us have this illusion
of privacy?  That the government is going to be so kind as to let
us 'sort of' exercise a RIGHT?  What you want to bet that I am
correct here?

Please answer  questions.  As citizens of the United States, we
hava a RIGHT to know what our Government plans to 'let' us have
out of the goodness of  hearts...

Funny thing, though - with all  proposals, I  feel ONE BIT
safer from drug dealers, terrorists, or a common street thug.  I am
beginning to wonder if the greater danger lies in the above entities,
or our own government gone out of control?

Re-assure us, please.  So far, I haven't seen much to reassure me...
and a LOT to greatly disturb me.

  Oh, that puts the debate on -excellent- terms for our side:

  FEDS:  You people saying that  is insecure  have any real
information to support that judgment.
  ME:  Fine -- show me this "information" that  prove me wrong.
  FEDS:  That's secret!

  When it comes down to that, it looks suspiciously like some government
official pasting "TOP SECRET" stamps over embarrasing information in 
to save his own hide.  In fact, framing the secrecy issue in that perspective
is more likely to turn Joe Sixpack's suspicions against the Feds than the
Constitutional argument -- a point I urge the others on the pro-freedom
side to consider when making  case.

   The  chip's User key is formed by:
 
           R1 = E[D[E[N1;S1];S2];S1]
           R2 = E[D[E[N2;S1];S2];S1]
           R3 = E[D[E[N3;S1];S2];S1]
 
   Why is the triple-encrytion used?  Is it just to gain an effective
increase in keyspace to defeat a potential keysearch?  (If so, why use
80 bit keys?)  Not knowing anything about the Skipjack algorithm, it's
not  possible to guess whether this makes it harder or easier to
guess S1,S2.
 
   Why are N1, N2, and N3 formed as they are?  It  be facinating to
see the Skipjack algorithm, to look for ways of attacking it that require
three ciphertext blocks formed in that odd way.
 
   Where do the 34-bit constant values that are concatenated with the
serial number to form N1,N2,N3 come from?  Are they changed from chip to
chip, or session to session?  (Even if they're published in the NY Times,
if SkipJack is resistant to known-plaintext attacks, when using triple-
encryption, then 's no break in security.  But why allow that kind
of weird format?  If  three 34-bit values are truly-random bits, then
maybe it's used to ensure that a known-plaintext attack on SkipJack, if
it exists, can't be easily used to derive S1 and S2 for a whole production
run of  chips....)
 
   Does Dorothy Denning read this group?  If not, is someone on the group
forwarding questions like  to her, or Martin Hellman, or anyone else
who's seen more details about the chip?

  The points raised about checking what is actually -in- the chip, as
opposed to what is allegedly programmed in, raise yet another trust
issue.  Even if we assume that  "trusted agents" are  entering
a wide range of S1 and S2 seeds (rather than using the same one all the
time to reduce the key search space to 30 bits), I assume they are not
doing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry
at caully selected points to encode data.  They  presumably be
punching numbers into a computer, which for all they know could program
the chips in a manner completely independent of the S1 and S2 values they
are feeding into the system.

You're blowing smoke.  Qualcomm wants to sell to nice, lucrative overseas
markets like Japan and the EC.  The government told them " do encryption
if you ever hope to export this technology".  The reason that CDMA doesn't
have encryption is NOT because the G-men came a'knocking at Qualcomm's door.
It's because Qualcomm doesn't  that the US market for digital cellular
is big enough for them.  This is just the International Traffic in Arms

If you  believe me, call Qualcomm and ASK THEM.   just throw
out conspicracy theories.  At least,  do it on sci.crypt-- are

Hah.  They're not that much more expensive.  Besides, if a drug dealer

No, Cylink sells  phones because they're willing to make different
stuff for domestic use vs. export.  Qualcomm isn't.  So Cylink makes
money--that's capitalism, comrade.

 discussed anywhere?  (I know Snefru is erenced in the RSA

   On a related topic, can anyone point me toward good sites to find

   I've been ing about how difficult it  be to make PGP available
in some form on EBCDIC machines.  The message authentication  be ugly,
but I  at least the IDEA encryption could work, if PGP had a switch
to tell it to use IDEA in OFB-mode or ECB-mode.  In OFB-mode, errors in
translating EBCDIC-->ASCII-->EBCDIC  only affect  byte, not the
16 bytes that  be affected under CBC.
   Is PGP set up to use different IDEA modes?  I  recall notincing it
in the executable, but I haven't gone through it as caully as I probably

I have been scanning and trying to read the  in the sci.crypt area,
but what do I get?   SURPRISINGLY, the blurb comes upon the screen " file xxx
has either been cancelled or expired.       Now I ask you, If it expired,
n't it be out of the available file cache?
I am 32 and not a paranoid, but the older I get, the greater my cynicism of
both federal and state governments becomes.    
The censorship  of this Internet (and it is no less than censorship [stupid me, it's the GOVT.])
is ridiculous.  The Japanese have far outstripped our ciphertechnology,  and 
our government is now, before your very observant eyes, trying to force the
"crypto standard" onto a framefork where the "standard" is now an ancient
relic in terms of modern Japanese security techniques.


Now, I pose the question: Why censor folks on the net and send the warning
shown above ("cancelled or expired") when it  be wiser to not let people
see the post at all??


Which  of the Constitution gives me the right of revolution if things
seem to be going cockeyed??

Please  be insulted, but based on this I  say that your
encryption algorithm is very likely not worth the paper it's printed
on.  If the NSA gave export approval, that  they felt confident
that they could crack it -- that's  JOB, mandated by LAW, and
I'm sure they believe in what they do.  If they gave export approval
to an encryption algorithm which they weren't confident of  able
to crack, they  be derelict in  sworn duty to monitor foreign
communications for US national security related material.

Just because many (most?) of us  that the government and the spooks
are pugnacious slimeballs is no reason to lose sight of the fact that
they do  jobs to the best of  ability, and further that said
ability is rather high.  I hope that one day we can make them all
obsolete....... but until then, we have to cope with  existence.
Export approvals are one thing they do that we can learn a lot from,
for example.

A person I know, belonging to a research lab of a rivate
company, claimed to me during a priavte conversation that, given the
equipment in his lab, he could crack a Kerberos ticket in 15 minutes to
an hour. He had access to rather powerful DES hardware, but not of an
extraordinare kind, I believe. The attack was possible because of the
amount of known plaintext in the ticket, which itself constitutes a small
message. This was two years ago.
DES is no longer usable for encryption of  sensitive data. For a
lot of purposes, however, it is  very adequate.

[story deleted]

Let me give you another story that actually happened to ME.  We sell
communications boards that use a 68000.  They used to be high tech. Our
agent in the UK sold a system to a company in CH which packaged it in a
product for CZ (London-Bern-Prague).  I telexed the Brits and told them
the Swiss need to pass export paperwork through the US as, at the time,
you needed an export lisence for  systems.

Now I knew the NSA was watching this traffic (just like they are watching
THIS traffic.)

And what do you know... two weeks later an agent of the US government shows
up in my office to remind me if we or our agents sold systems into the Evil
Empire, we had better make sure the export lisences were handled properly.

He was part of a FIVE man office in COLUMBUS OHIO!! who did this stuff
based on sources he could not reveal. (I assume most of the time 
guys sat around the office with  thumbs up  ass as  isn't
that much stuff coming out of Columbus :)

Wow, the electric utility in Prague sure is a big worry for  folks :)

The point is, we have created a giant bureaucracy (NSA) with a budget
bigger than the CIA's who, like all bureaucracies, fill  time looking
for things to do.  The Evil Empire is gone.  The NSA is not.  They will do
something to fill  time and justify  budgets.  (I just wish they
too  sit around with  thumbs up  ass... but that is too
much to hope for... they will spy on us and do things like skipjack and
subvert people like Dorothy Denning.)  Sigh...

I believe it's legal to send DES code or equipment from the US to Canada
with no export license.  I  this is the only place you can do this - all
other countries require a license.

As an aside, I've always thought it  be legal to send DES software
anywhere, if you follow  rules:

   1.  Encrypt your DES software with DES.
   2.  Send the encrypted software to the recipient.
   3.  Send the key to the recipient.

The only way the person on the other end can use your DES software is if
he/she already *has* DES available - otherwise, they can't decrypt your
program, and it is useless.  If you've guaranteed they already have DES,
have you  violated any law by sending it to them in the form of
your program??  I'm sure it's  illegal, but it seems like a good idea...

I seem to recall Rush saying that he has a CompuServe account.  If anyone
wants to E-mail him, all we need is his account number (i.e.: 12345,6789)
and then we could e-mail him via gateway by using a dot instead of a comma
like so: "12345.6789@compuserve.com".  (THIS IS *NOT* HIS ADDRESS.)

So, does anyone know his e-mail address?  He *says* he uses it all the time.

Good idea, But why put all the eggs in one basket?

Given that the  keys are generated 200 at a time on floppy disks, why
not keep them  rather than creating one huge database that will have to
be guarded better than Fort Knox.

Give each floppy to a different bank for safekeeping. The USA has over 10,000
banks and thrifts -  are not likely to be more than 2,000,000 
phones sold.

in this programming procedure?  2-4 people, a laptop, only 300 chips at

it is a minute per chip, it will take the greater part of a day to 
turn out 300 of  things.  How long do you suppose it will take to

Something similar has happened to me - ages ago when we were working on PGP
we used to send short messages about development issues or simply to test 
new features around.  Now at this time PGP (and certainly the newer version)
was unknown over here.  Suddenly the admin at the site I was using received
a request that I stop sending encrypted email.  Now  is almost no way
that some automatic scanner could have found this,  they n't have
known about PGP - they *must* have checked for unknown data types in the
message, tried to unscramble it, found they couldn't get past the PEM
armour part, and then contacted the sysadmin and asked me to stop.  Luckily
the current email carriers are less picky about what goes over 
networks :-).

In case people  email scanning doesn't take place, I can assure you
that it is done regularly by many sites - usually not by government
agencies (or at least not that I know of), but by local administrators who,
for reasons of  own, have decided to monitor all communications
(I'm sure you can all  of a whole mess of reasons - stop hackers/
terrorists/child pornographers/drug dealers/evil commies/whatever).  
have been several occasions when I've got people into trouble simply by
including the traditional NSA bait in a message (I  try it any more
now :-).  A friend of mine was once picked up for mentioning the name of
the UK town of Scunthorpe (hint: look for words embedded in it).  I'm sure
 are many more examples of this happening (in fact if anyone has any
examples I'd appreciate hearing from them - I could use them as
ammunition during talks on privacy issues).

It is tempting (albeit chauvinistic) to believe that we have a new situation
here, thanks to our pet computers.  This is not true.   Kahn's "The
Codebreakers", a history of cryptography, makes two things obvious:

1.	Cryptography is a spontaneous invention of private human individuals
	and has been going on for thousands of years.  [Teen-age slang and
	cipher inventions provide a modern example of this spontaneous
	creation.]

2.	The systems people created on  own were roughly as secure as (and
	sometimes more secure than)  used by military and diplomatic
	users *of that time* (although they seem very simple and insecure
	today). [e.g., In places, the Bible used a more complex simple
	substitution than Caesar did for his military dispatches, but before
	Caesar.]

I commend Kahn's book to all who might be interested.

I   mr. Clinton can even understand the technical details of

al, if he gives them he just says what a panel of experts(?) told him.

You  realize that form letters are the *worst* way to influence
your congresscritters; exact copies are routinely placed on the lowest
rung of the opinion ladder.

If you want to write (and I  you !), take the time to 
*write* a letter.  Things to emphasize:

	- It's been said that Usenet is available to the 'technical
	  elite', i.e. the techies at corporate sites and universi-
	  ties.  Emphasize that you are part of the group that will
	  be making/developing/using Clinton's 'data superhighway.'

	- Explain how you are intimately familiar with both computing
	  and data communications. (if this is the case;  call your-
	  self an 'expert' after wiring in a 1200 bps modem.)   This
	  will distinguish your letter from the random flamers.  
	  turn it into braggadocio; just tell them that you know the
	  technical sides of the issue.

	-  overdo jargon and gobbledygook.  Remember, your letter
	  will be first read (in all likelihood) by a staffer who may
	  even be a college student; if they  understand it, your
	  views won't even make the 'running total' sheets.

	- Be concise;  ramble.  Rants are *definitely* out of place.
	  Cite , if necessary, but only use "accepted" 
	  like academic journals.  "My neighbor Jim" is *not* a real er-
	  ence.  8)

	- Unfortunately, very few Congresscritters ** understand
	  electronic communications.  Encourage them to pick up access
	  to Compuserve, America Online, or one of the Free-Nets.  Offer
	  to send them samples.  If you are in a position to do so, offer
	  them (or  staffers back in the home state) access to your
	  systems.  Offer to give a demonstration the next time they're in
	  town.  Your offer to get *personally* involved in helping them
	  *will* give your opinions more credence.

	- In addition to sending mail to your representatives, send mail
	  to the members of the committee (or subcommittee) that is dealing
	  with the issue.  If your Congresscritter isn't on the committee,
	  they can't be of much help until the matter comes to the floor.

--Wes

ps> I'd suggest drawing analogies between digital communication and the
    more traditional media, but Usenet doesn't have a decent track record
    in the analogy department.  8)

Before they do some real damage??  You haven't been paying attention, it

He'll slam Clinton for anything at all on the air.  I just do not
understand why he remains so popular.  He'll take a piece of video of
Clinton walking along; find a frame in which Clinton wrinkles his
nose, say; freeze on it and blow it up full screen; and then rant for
five minutes on how no one could possibly trust someone with such a
face and such beady greedy little eyes.  I've seen this on his TV show
(it was around the time of the inauguration).  Can anyone call this
stuff legitimate (I hate to say "informed") commentary?  How can
anyone with half a brain in his or her head[1] continue to watch
it[2]?

The American TV-watching (and I guess radio-listening) public never
ceases to amaze me.

Better, I , is our right peacably to assemble.  I have a right to meet
you in a park and talk privately.  I have a right to see if anyone is
nearby, listening.

In cyberspace, cryptography gives us a right to assemble with control over
who overhears us.

 is one point I'd like to make, that most people seem to have forgotten.
That is that one of the underlining principles in the Constitution is a DISTRUST
of governmental authority and control. All  "checks & balances" is because
they realize that you  distrust  in power. What everyone seems to have
forgotten as well is the original reason that the Bill of Rights guaranteed the
right to bear arms. It's inclusion was not to allow you to protect yourself
against other citizens, but to prevent the government from taking away your only
 of protecting yourself from an armed and aggressive government. Its hard to
oppress your citizenry when its armed against you.

I am not a fanatic, I'm a retired Naval officer. Because I have spent so much
time defending it, perhaps I understand its "purpose" as well as its "plan".

Thats one problem that has so far been overlooked.  two 
agencies will have to create a secure database and service the
input and output of Keys. Who pays for this? If they use an
illegal request from some congressman to deliver a key can 
budget by cut to punish them? Will congress be forced to fund
them forever?

The problem is that laws can change. Congress may pass a law setting
up an  agency with instructions that keys are private. Some
future congress may change that law. Suppose pre-nazi Germany had
a  system. Do you  the  agencies  have
told Hitler that he could not have the keys without a valid 
 ?

In effect you must set up  agencies as a fourth branch of
the goverment and isolate them from any outside interferance. 
They will be able to directly tap into Federal funds with no
accountability to anyone except through a  challenge.

I  know about you, but I have nearly forgotten how to generate paper
mail.

If I had e-mail to Congress, I  have written many letters by now.
I haven't written one yet, as it turns out.  Writing on paper is such
a complicated job, for  of us hooked on our way-cool Internet.

This sounds an awful lot like a password-guesser, not a weakness in
DES.  Merritt and I pointed out this weakness in Kerberos in a paper
that came out about 2.5 years ago, in both Computer Communications
Review and Usenix.  For that matter, it was loudly discussed on the
Kerberos mailing list even earlier.

The problem has nothing whatsoever to do with DES, and everything to do
with bad password selection.

I'm perfectly willing to believe that  are cryptanalytic attacks
possible on DES.  I'm quite dubious that private research labs know
them.  And the parameters of a brute-force attack are quite well
established; see, for example, the Garon and Outerbridge paper in the
July '91 Cryptologia.  You're not going to do it in an hour with only
``rather powerful DES hardware''.  I'll leave the arithmetic as an
exercise for the reader.  On average, you'll need to do 2^55 trials.
Pick your own parameters for how fast the DES engine runs, and for
how many such engines are used.

I came. I lurked. I read the FAQ.

Now having purchased the recommended books, and having taken to heart the advice that
one knows nothing about crypto without having done a stint as a cryptanalyst, I  like
to correspond with people interested in cryptology.

I am working on implementing the cryptanalyst's workbench example in Booch's OOD with
Applications. I hope to start sending ciphers back and forth so each of us can practice cracking
them.  I  like to start with simple Ceaser's ciphers and progress roughly according to
 Kahn's book. Of course I  be interested in general discussions and math also.

I hope to have some foriegn correspondants so that we can test the response time of the
"men in the suits" I've been hearing so much about. Unfortunately as a product of the American
education system I only know English.

Looking forward to any and all responses.

Gasp!

I've just spent 3 hours catching up on sci.crypt here (slow reader I
guess) and I  have to put out a few comments too.  First, let me
flame the famous Dave S. : He's obviously only 10 years old.  Cut him
some slack. :^}

The joke about Clinton/crypto/drugs slammed me thru the roof.  Nice job
guys!  I've been working on marijuana legalization for over 5 years
now, Clinton's actions so far have  helped.  But because of
government action taken against various other groups, I have developed
a 64 bit DES based on public literature to protect my mailing list.
The S-boxes are the critical component, and  I chose 32 out of 57
based on the key, cracking this DES is going to tough.  (The reason it
slows you down a touch is that for each key you try you need to use a
different set of s-boxes, I know it's only a vector, but it sure makes
random search a pain).  Several marijuana legalization groups have had
 mailing lists confiscated when people were charged with drug
use/sales.  It's not a crime to be a member of a legalization org,
*but* you will be watched.

It  is important to write a letter to every official you
personally vote for to explain *why* your privacy is  destroyed by
the "cripple chip".  Amazingly enough they do listen when they get
*enough* mail.  The Doonsbery jokes about NRA postcards are real, and
the IMI (Illinois Marijuana Initiative) has grown to the point where we
*are* seeing some changes.

It's pretty clear that all the hullabaloo is  about the
implimentation decision  made behind our backs.  As Vesselin
points out, this was common practice in communist regimes (and may be
again depending on how the vote goes).  But just as criminals have guns
and "law abiding" citizens , and criminals like me have marijuana
and "law abiding" s , criminals like me will have secure
crypto  "law abiding" robots .  PGP is nice, but as time goes
on we all can do better.  And to save our hides we will.

Someone posted an excerpt from Machiavelli.  He's my favorite dude.
500 years ago he saw clearly how people *are*, and tried to explain
that to "princes" who wanted people to *obey*.  One section not quoted
(I've got "The Prince" at home, so I'll just paraphrase :) ) had to do
with conquring a free city.  The only way is to *completly destroy*
it.  Failing that, you must appoint locals to high positions and accept
the people's customs.  Even after 100 years of oppression, a people
will remember  heratige and rise up to overthrow the oppresive
government.  And he gave an example.  And that was 300 years *before*
Thomas Jefferson.

 were questions about watching traffic.  Only *interesting* traffic
is watched: stuff that goes overseas and comes back; stuff with keywords
like marijauana, cryptography, NSA;  certain individuals who are known
subversives, etc.  It is easy enough to store all that traffic.  So if
you know how to be *subversive* i.e. how to be unseen, it's pretty easy
to go unnoticed for a long time.  The stronger your crypto system and the
less you're noticed, the better your chances of developing an 
which can diseminate truth to the masses.

Which gets me to the thread about a "public encrypted conference".
That's just silly.  The first thing the feds do is send in an
infiltrator (like Dave S.) and they know what you're doing.  It will be
fun for teenagers and college students, but for the real world it's
pretty pointless.  Crypto is useful for more things than hiding where
you get your marijuana.

Guns, drugs and crypto do have some commonality:  are people in
government who want you to *obey*  rules.  As Lundquist says in
alt.drugs "Live free or ".  Machiavelli pointed out that's just
how most people actually live, inspite of appearences to the contrary.
It's true that the decision to shove the  (not the same thing as
Intergraph's!!!) down our throats violates the principles of what the
U.S. was founded on, but the government is full of idiotic robots
called bureaucrats and 's less to worry about than one might
.  Only  innocent (read naive) s of the U.S. will be
hurt by this, the rest of us *criminals* will live in secure freedom.
de Toqueville pointed out 150+ years ago that the tyranny of the
majority will be mitigated by the mediocrity of the government.

And given what I see government officials doing where I work (Argonne
National Lab.) the level of stupidity makes Dave S. look smart.

   Maybe so, but it's quite common.  are millions of Macintosh users who
   have no idea what's in Apple's patented ROMs. Many have modems connected.
   How do you know all your business secrets aren't  stolen? Answer:
   1. Because you trust Apple;
   2. Because if any such attempt, however sophicsticated, came out, it 
   destroy Apple's credibility forever.

Then 's also
3) Because it's NOT SECRET.  If I want to, I CAN go look at Apple's
copyrighted ROMs in a Mac, so they're not keeping any secrets.  
You  even have to pry the top off the chip and use an electron microscope,
you just have to read the data in memory and see if you can figure out what it .
(Motorola object code isn't all *that* obscure!)  
Yes, it's copyrighted, so I can't go selling copies, or using the copy myself,
but I CAN see it, and disassemble it.

4) They're not asking me to trust  honesty.  They're asking me to
trust the quality of  assembly language programming :-),
but I can see for myself what the performance, price, and crashes/day are.
NSA, an  not known for its honesty or openness, 
is asking me to trust them with my privacy, but they won't trust me.  Feh!

   You're blowing smoke.  Qualcomm wants to sell to nice, lucrative overseas
   markets like Japan and the EC.  The government told them " do encryption
   if you ever hope to export this technology".  The reason that CDMA doesn't
   have encryption is NOT because the G-men came a'knocking at Qualcomm's door.
   It's because Qualcomm doesn't  that the US market for digital cellular
   is big enough for them.  This is just the International Traffic in Arms
   Regulations all over again.

Perry has already stated on the net that Qualcomm wanted to sell overseas, and
the government told them they n't be allowed to export,
so he's only blowing the same smoke you are :-)
Sure, they probably could have made a US version, and a non-crypto
export version, and contracted with a Bulgarian or Japanese software house to
develop an overseas crypto ROM, but that's getting pretty expensive.

   No, Cylink sells  phones because they're willing to make different
   stuff for domestic use vs. export.  Qualcomm isn't.  So Cylink makes
   money--that's capitalism, comrade.

Well, some people like capitalism, and others per free enterprise;
they're different!  Using the government to stifle your competition is capitalist.

   >Someone out  WILL build a unit to do all this. Better yet,
   >prehaps someone will produce a package that turns any 486 box with a

   "Someone" this and "someone" that.  If you  it's so easy, why are
   you whining on the net instead of getting your butt in gear and writing it?

Writing good crypto code is something most good programmers can do;
writing good new crypto algorithms is a very specialized skill.
Developing new voice coding algorithms is also pretty specialized,
but finding ways to implement the more complex ones when you 
have enough horsepower is  fairly hairy stuff.
Once the 586/Pentium becomes widespread, or the next generation of
sound boards has DSPs on it, I suspect we'll see it happen.
Maybe the vanilla 486+Soundblaster is enough.

   Doug Holland claims Tom Clancy has provided the recipe for nuclear bombs.
   Clancy himself says he has omitted certain crucial steps. Further, how do we

On the other hand, when John Aristotle Phillips was a junior at Princeton
trying to keep from flunking physics by doing a terrific term paper,
his atom bomb design was good enough that it got classified.
A few of the steps were derived from social engineering 
(e.g. the name of the explosive), but it was fundamentally sound (and DID get an A.)
The Pakistan embassy also called him up trying to get a copy;
at the time they were lobbying the US government to get some nuclear
reactors for "purely non-military" electrical power generation.

I reproduce in full below.  Is it time to get together to develop
a tcp/ip standard for crypto voice that we could then layer on

pgp is for mail?

In case you'd like to experiment with CELP, you can obtain a software
implementation of the 4800 bps Fed Std CELP coder for free:

The U.S. DoD's Federal-Standard-1016 based 4800 bps code excited linear

In addition to the source codes, example input and processed speech files
are included along with a technical information bulletin to assist in
implementation of FS-1016 CELP.  (An anonymous ftp site is  considered
for future releases.)

Copies of the actual standard "Federal Standard 1016, Telecommunications:

The easiest way is a user fee for each  chip manufactured. This makes
the funding separate from government.

It also has the neat side property that if the chip doesn't catch on, the
scheme breaks down, and the government is back to the drawing boards,
assuming that they haven't prohibited alternatives in the meantime.

In fact, maybe this  be part of the "official" system. Before the
government is allowed to move this past the "experimental" stage, they
 have to demonstrate economic viability by mass adoption. The
government is very fond of demonstration projects proving feasibility in the
use of government funds for social programs--they  have to make a
similar feasibility demonstration (on economic viability cum acceptance
terms) for this baby as well. Let's put it to the only vote that counts--a
marketplace vote among  who have to pay for it.

Meeting of the UK Cryptoprivacy Association
- -------------------------------------------

Saturday, 8 May 1993, 1500

To be held at the offices of:

  FOREST
  4th floor
  2 Grosvenor Gardens
  London  SW1W 0DH

This is located at the corner of Hobart Place, a couple of
blocks west of Victoria Station, and almost directly across from
the dark green cabbie shelter.

If you have trouble finding the place, please call the office on
071-823-6550.  Or, call me (Russell Whitaker) on my pager,
081-812-2661, and leave an informative message with the
telephone number where you can be reached; I will return the
call almost immediately.

Discussion will range from the usual general topics, such as the
use of secure public key cryptosystems to protect message data, to
specific topics, such as recent moves by the U.S. government
to restrict choice in data privacy (erence recent discussion
on Usenet groups, e.g. sci.crypt and alt.security.pgp).

All are invited.  Particularly welcome are members of the
newly-formed UK CommUnity group ... the local
EFF-in-spirit-if-not-in-name folks.

 who plan to attend  email me and let me know.
Please.

All attendees are requested to bring diskettes - perably
MS-DOS - with  PGP 2.+ public keys.  As is usual at 
gatherings, several of us will bring our laptops, and will sign
public keys,  to the usual caveats (erence the
documentation for PGP 2.2, specifically files PGPDOC1.DOC and
PGPDOC2.DOC).

If you do not already have a copy of PGP 2.2 (MS-DOS), and 
like to have a copy of this public domain program, please bring
a formatted, medium or high density 3.5 inch floppy PC diskette;
you will be provided a copy of the program.

Of course, you might per to ftp a version of the program from
one of the various archive sites.  I suggest trying Demon
Internet Systems, which carries the full range of PGP (Phil
Zimmerman's "Pretty Good Privacy") implementations: directory
/pub/pgp at gate.demon.co.uk.

Meetings are of indeterminate time.   who are interested
are invited to join the rest of us at a pseudorandomly
determined pub afterwards.

Please note:
- ------------
In the past few months, interested people have emailed me,
requesting FAQs and special information mailings.  I regret
that, except in very unusual cases (e.g. working press), I
cannot, in a timely manner, respond to  requests.  I will,
however - and for the first time - do a writeup of this meeting,
which I will post in various places.

What I *am* willing to supply is general information on our
activities for the maintainers of existing FAQs, such as that
for alt.privacy.  FAQ maintainers can contact me at
whitaker@eternity.demon.co.uk

One very interesting thing I notice about this is that the only use of
the chip key is to encode the session key for the law enforcement field.
It is not used at all by the encryption algorithm.

It seems like it  be possible to create a device that  be
otherwise compatible, but  send out a bogus law enforcement field.
This might render the device unusable with "normal" devices if 's
some sort of validation involving the law enforcement field, but it
could certainly be used with other such modified devices.

Of course, this is irrelevant if the NSA has a backdoor in the
algorithm, but it does make it possible to defeat the key  system.

CompuServe is in Columbus, OH.  So are the corporate headquarters of several 
major insurance companies, the largest private R&D company in the world 
(Batelle Memorial Institute), DCSC (The Defense Construction & Supply

OCLC (the Online College Library Center), and so on.  You'd be amazed,

This  will just scratch the surface of a few security
considerations, comments are requested. (email: fw@world.std.com)
My thanks to the people who responded, both on usenet and from
Oracle Corp.

The most common response was to suggest use of oracle audit 
features or OPS$ passwords to control access (opinion on OPS$
included suggestions to use and not use). I was also advised to 
use table views to ine the granularity of access control.

One important security consideration in networked installations
is that OPS$ accounts presume that the client host provides user
authentication. Os/2 server OPS$ users are only as secure as the 
_least_ secure machine on the network. Hence you  probably 
not define any OPS$ accounts on systems with PC's, or limit access 
of OPS$ accounts to data with no security concerns. Unix oracle 
servers provide for disabling OPS$ access over the network (orasrv
option),  relying on host security for local processes. 

Internally Oracle provides powerful and well documented (sic) 
audit mechanisms which the DBA will use to monitor system and
data access.  tools can be used to track the primary security
risks from within the Oracle environment.

Oracle password security is based on a proprietary usage of DES
encryption. Oracle Corp. states that the algorithm is not prone
to cleartext attack. This is a difficult claim to substantiate 
 the algorithm is unknown. The concern here is that if users 
choose easily guessed passwords. _If_ a cracker can gain access 
to your oracle database files through the host operating system, 
s/he could extract the 'cyphertext' password data and apply 
cryptanalysis techniques to learn the users passwords.

As security risks go, the above scenario is pretty low severity.
Certainly once an intruder has access to the raw database files,
s/he can access to the data in them. If a cracker _could_ break 
the passwords, however, s/he could do substantial damage without
alerting the auditing mechanism's, and leaving and audit trail
which  point to valid users. At present Oracle (like Unix)
provides no native  of ensuring that passwords are not 
guessable. 

As with all computer security, the most important defense is to 
educate users in the safe choice of passwords.  techniques
are well discussed in internet rfc#1281 and the Crack manual, 
(both available from ftp archive servers) and, UNIX(R) System 
Security (Curry,  A. - Addison-Welsey 1992)

This analogy fails in its assumption that the government gives two
squirts about credibility.


In addition, Apple's proclaimed purpose in releasing the Macintosh wasn't
survellience.

Quite the opposite:
"On January 24, Apple will introduce.... Macintosh, and you'll see why
1984 won't be, like '1984'"

So  give me any bullshit analogies about how we trust coke not to
put mind control drugs in every can to get us to buy more.

One of the reasons we  be all the more suspicious.  When was the

Just another reason to look closely at exactally what's going on.

OK, I heard a lot of talk about the NSA's infamous control over encryption
export through the ITAR.  Here's a question.  Say I develop this great new
encryption system, and I want to sell my software worldwide.  The thought
police then come in and say "This algorithm is a threat to national security.
You will not be permitted to export it."  At this point, what kind of trouble
could I get into if I ignored the ITAR and sold my program to international
customers anyway?

Pat Myrto says if law enforcement wants keys, let them get a   and
then ask him for them.

Most use of probably cause wiretapping warrants isn't to decrypt historical
traffic, but for prospective listening once probably cause is established.
Pat's approach  tip off the crooks.

Well, they can't listen in on much of mine,  I already use
cryptography for much of my electronic mail, and will start using it
for my telephony as soon as practical.

However, allow me to tell a parable.

 was once a far away land called Ruritania, and in Ruritania
 was a strange phenonmenon -- all the trees that grew in
Ruritainia were transparent. Now, in the days when people had lived in
mud huts, this had not been a problem, but now high-tech wood
technology had been developed, and in the new age of wood, everyone in
Ruritania found that  homes were all 100% see through. Now, until
this point, no one ever thought of allowing the police to spy on
someone's home, but the new technology made this tempting. This 
a civilized country, however, warrants were required to use binoculars
and watch someone in  home. The police, taking advantage of this,
 get warrants to use binoculars and peer in to see what was going
on. Occassionally, they  use binoculars without a warrant, but
everyone pretended that this didn't happen.

One day, a smart man invented paint -- and if you painted your house,
suddenly the police couldn't watch all your actions at will. Things
 go back to the way they were in the old age -- completely
private.

Indignant, the state decided to try to require that all homes have
video cameras installed in every nook and cranny. "After all", they
said, "with this new development crime could run rampant. Installing
video cameras doesn't mean that the police get any new capability --
they are just keeping the old one."

A wise man pointed out that citizens were not obligated to make the
lives of the police easy, that the police had survived all through the
mud hut age without  able to watch the citizens at will, and that
Ruritania was a civilized country where not everything that was
expedient was permitted. For instance, in a neighboring country, it
had been discovered that torture was an extremely effective way to
solve crimes. Ruritania had banned this practice in spite of its
expedience. Indeed, "why have warrants at all", he asked, "if we are
interested only in expedience?"

A famous paint technologist, Dorothy Quisling, intervened however. She
noted that people might take photographs of children masturbating
 the new paint technology be widely deployed without safeguards,
and the law was passed.

Soon it was discovered that some citizens  cover  mouths
 speaking to each other, thus preventing the police from reading
 lips through the video cameras. This had to be prevented, the
police said. After all, it was preventing them from conducting 
lawful surveilance. The wise man pointed out that the police had never
before been allowed to listen in on people's homes, but Dorothy
Quisling pointed out that people might use this new invention of
covering  mouths with veils to discuss the kidnapping and
mutilation of children. No one in the legislature wanted to be accused
of  in favor of mutilating children, but then again, no one
wanted to interfere in people's rights to wear what they liked, so a
compromise was reached whereby all homes were installed with
microphones in each room to accompany the video cameras. The wise man
lamented few if any child mutilations had ever been solved by the old
lip reading technology, but it was too late -- the microphones were
installed everwhere.

However, it was discovered that this was insufficient to prevent
citizens from hiding information from the authorities, because some of
them  cleverly speak in languages that the police could not
understand. A new law was proposed to force all citizens to speak at
all times only in Ruritanian, and, for good measure, to require that
they speak clearly and distinctly near the microphones. "After all",
Dorothy Quisling pointed out, "they might be using the opportunity to
speak in private to mask terrorist activities!"  Terrorism struck
terror into everyone's hearts, and they rejoiced at the brulliance of
this new law.

Mean, the wise man talked one evening to his friends on how all
of this was making a sham of the constitution of Ruritania, of which
all Ruritanians were proud. "Why", he asked, "are we obligated to
sacrifice all our freedom and privacy to make the lives of the police

Arthur Melnick posts an interesting first-hand message about his NEA
algorithm. Though I have no reason to disbelieve anything he says, I want to
clarify one point:

He says he has no connection with the NSA. If he was part of an "NSA plot",
of course he'd say that.

Now I   he is. But the level of some discussion here is of that
sort, and very quickly we reach the point where it's impossible to continue
rationally discussing some issues.

   Glad to!  You are correct, it is illegal to send cryptographic
code (and lots of other things) out of the country without a license.
HOWEVER, every US citizen has a general export license, allowing
export of lots of things, including constitutionally protected speech.
This has the effect that it is legal for US citizens to export some
things which it is illegal for a US corporation to export without
first obtaining a license.

   > Dunno if you'd get one for the particular code you have; the only

   Nope, talk to a good lawyer in the area of export law.  But, in
general, the government has to have a very good national security case
to try prevent the export of anything you personally might wish to
publish.  (Yes, I worded that the way I did intentionally.  It is a
lot easier for the government to TRY to prevent the export of
information than to charge someone with a crime after the fact.
Espionage is probably the only exception.)

    If you are a US citizen, you have a general license.  (I am not a
lawyer, so take some of this with a grain of salt.  However, I have
also had to swim through both ITAR and export regs in a few cases.)

We  like to keep it that way. Thats the point. By reacting
strongly and forcefully now, we will assure that we continue to remain
free. You cannot overreact to a threat like this. The worst that
happens if we overreact is that we waste time and effort. The worst that
happens if we underreact is tyranny. I per overreaction myself.

>GUESS WHAT PEOPLE?  You live in one of the few countries in the world
>where a person can complain without getting shot at.  

Doesn't that tell you how precious and hard to maintain freedom is?

Only through centuries of overreaction have we managed to maintain
ourselves in this state of even moderate freedom. I suggest that
overreacting now and in the future is a good thing.

   I've got an idea that  remove most of the political complaints
I have about the  chip.  Pass a law stating that if, within a
year of performaing a wiretap on someone, a police agency hasn't
managed to convict the suspect of the crime the warrant/wiretap was for,
then that agency owes the suspect $1 million to repay him/her for
lost privacy.
   Of course,  are ** problems with the technical aspects of
, and with the one-size-fits-all mentality that  be behind
an attempt to enforce it as a standard.  But this  be a way for
 in favor of allowing continued wiretaps to assure us that it will
only be used in cases where the crime is important and the police are
all but certain that   will be a conviction....

	Again we have the trust in government problem here. Members of 
Mr. Sternlight's generation trust the government to a degree which
members of my generation find ridiculous. I  suggest that Mr. Sternlight
read about the COINTELPRO program, or about J. Edgar Hoover, or about
the wire-tapping of Martin Luther King, then, after he has digested this
information he can ponder the fact that  the government does not
tap every conversation that they have a record of tapping many conversations
that they have no right to, even under  own laws. Given the long
history of members of the US government ignoring the laws that apply
to them, it is no wonder that so many people in here sound so paranoid, and
given the fact that it is often difficult or impossible to punish 
individuals once they are discovered, it is no wonder that so many people

\maketitle

A message-digest algorithm maps a message of arbitrary length to a
``digest'' of fixed length, and has three properties: Computing the
digest is easy, finding a message with a given
digest---``inversion''---is hard, and finding two messages with the
same digest---``collision''---is also hard. Message-digest algorithms
have many applications, including digital signatures and message
authentication.

RSA Data Security's MD5 message-digest algorithm, developed by Ron
Rivest \cite{rfc-md5}, maps a message to a 128-bit message digest.
Computing the digest of a one-megabyte message takes as little as a
second.   no message-digest algorithm can yet be {\em proved}
secure, MD5 is believed to be at least as good as any other that maps
to a 128-bit digest.  Inversion  take about $2^{128}$
operations, and collision  take about $2^{64}$ operations.  No
one has found a faster approach to inversion or collision.

Recent work by den Boer and Bosselaers \cite{den-boer-md5} presents
a special kind of ``pseudocollision'' in MD5's
internal compression function, which maps
a 512-bit message block $x$ and a
128-bit input state $s$ to a 128-bit output
state. They show how to find a message block $x$
and two related input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ that yield the same
output state: $f(x,s_1)$ = $f(x,s_2)$.  well-thought approach
exploits structural properties of the collision function to find 
a pseudocollision in about $2^{16}$ operations, much less than one
 expect.

Practical implications of this pseudocollision work to the security of
MD5 are not evident.  a real collision in MD5 implies a
pseudocollision (or a ``pseudo-inversion''), a
pseudocollision need not imply a real collision. Indeed, a real
collision,  it involves two different messages,  almost
always involve {\em different} message blocks $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that
$f(x_1,s_1) = f(x_2,s_2)$, but the pseudocollisions have the same
message blocks. Moreover, the input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ 
generally be unrelated, but the pseudocollisions' input states are
the same except for four bits.   does not seem to be any way to
extend den Boer and Bosselaers' approach to anything beyond the
special pseudocollisions, a limitation they readily admit.

It is reasonable, theore, to believe that MD5 remains secure.  den
Boer and Bosselaers have found interesting structural properties in
MD5, the properties seem only to lead to special pseudocollisions
and not anything approaching real collisions. Further research, of
course, will give a better understanding of the strengths of MD5 and
other message-digest algorithms, with the eventual hope that
such algorithms can, in some sense, be proved secure.

In  <strnlghtC5yBKA.Dp5@netcom.com> strnlght@netcom.com ( Sternlight) 
brings up the issue of how the  agent will be paid, and the fact
that the government had financial leverage if they  cooperate.
It's an important issue, especially if one of the  agents
decides they'd rather stop offering the service. 
I assume that if the  agent isn't the government,
then the contract for providing  service  include some
termination clause like returning the keys.

>   The easiest way is a user fee for each  chip manufactured. 
>   This makes the funding separate from government.

But who's the user paying the fees here, and what's the service?  
If the user is the government, then the funding's not separate from the government.

If the user is the buyer, what's the service?  
Keeping the key for me?  No thanks - I  need, and won't buy  service!
Not telling everybody my key?  Sounds like blackmail!

If the user is the manufacturer, does the user have a choice about buying?
The alternative is to just generate the key and not  it, which is fine -
I'd certainly pay more for this kind of key than an ed key!

Face it, the  provider is providing a service the users  want.
The only people who want it are the government, not the users.
What you're  talking about is either the government paying for
the service, up front or per-year, either from general taxes,
or from a special direct tax on wiretap chips, or on an indirect tax
(forcing the manufacturer to pay the fee to the  agent.)

I hope the  people have no way of finding out your name from
your serial number, especially if the  is a government agency.

Here in New Jersey, we have lots of people willing to provide that
sort of services for user fees.   are people willing to keep your
store from burning down for a small monthly fee, though sometimes people
use to pay and discover that the service  was effective.
If you go to a baseball game at Yankee Stadium,  are people who
will watch your car in the parking lot for a small user fee.
Something could scratch the paint, after all.
And what a shame if your  key got out!

What is the reason for the push on ?

Two days after the lead story here in the Mercury Times (murky news)
 was another  on industrial espionage by the french.

Someone had said what can it hurt to allow the government to have
continued access to our communications, they already have it.  The
problem is that, yes the do have access, and probably more than
we realize.  The government wants exclusive access to communications
intercept here in the united states, cutting out other access detrimental
to the national security (tm).

I also doubt that a certain3 letter agency, that originated the encryption
algorithm and the chip designs needs to have anything to do with the 
 system to continue  intercept effort.  

Better yet, who owns the company doing the programming?

My choice for the escow house  be the Smithsonian, and someplace on
the west coast.  My biggest concern isn't that the  house could
be compromised (it will be), but the fact it has been compromised will
be kept secret.  

The keys could be kept under glass, with 24-hour C-SPAN coverage.  If you
thought your key had been stolen just turn on the cable, and wait until
the roving camera reachs the musuem case with your key.  Or if you  the
C-SPAN satellite has been compromised, take a tour of the Smithsonian
yourself, and view the seal on your key.

   OK, I heard a lot of talk about the NSA's infamous control over encryption
   export through the ITAR.  Here's a question.  Say I develop this great new
   encryption system, and I want to sell my software worldwide.  The thought
   police then come in and say "This algorithm is a threat to national security.
   You will not be permitted to export it."  At this point, what kind of trouble
   could I get into if I ignored the ITAR and sold my program to international
   customers anyway?

First of all, it's not the thought police, it's the export police.
If you move overseas with your great thoughts in your head, write the software ,
and then sell it, the US Thought Police probably can't do too much about it,
though you might want to check with your lawyer first.

However, if you write the program here, and sell it to furriners,
you are now an international arms dealer and can get thrown in the
clink for *many* years, especially if they decide you'd be a good example,
and Cuban Drug Dealers and Fanatic Middle Eastern Terrorists buy your stuff.

(Definitions of "public domain" are different for ITAR purposes, so if
you've got a good enough lawyer who'll do your case for free after
they've confiscated everything you own as evidence, you might win.
But nobody wants to go first,  the stakes are _quite_ high.)

	Well, actually, this one's easy. It's  job. The NSA is
supposed to develop cryptosystems. If the government chooses to go
ahead and sell  cryptosystems to the masses, so be it.

	This sounds a lot like slamming the competition, not a cry
for justice.  guys are way out on a limb, if I read that right.
They've commited  new algorithm to silicon before it's been
made public. What are they gonna do if Shamir  a paper showing
how to crack the entire class of algorithms in 5 minutes with a slide
rule and a pencil?

	If they weren't busy throwing muck to smear  competitors,
I'd feel kinda sorry for 'em.  do, a little.

Thank you .  Not only for the firm rebuttal, but for understanding the

Why do people just not understand that just because all  pretty songs about

I forwarded an old posting about CELP speech compression:

	In case you'd like to experiment with CELP, you can obtain a software
	implementation of the 4800 bps Fed Std CELP coder for free:

	The U.S. DoD's Federal-Standard-1016 based 4800 bps code excited linear
	prediction voice coder version 3.2 (CELP 3.2) Fortran and C simulation source
	codes are now available for worldwide  at no charge (on DOS
	diskettes, but configured to compile on Sun SPARC stations) from:

I've  been told that the source of this is on cygnus.com
in /pub/celp.speech.tar.Z

I'm not in a position to; any Sun tcp/ip gurus out  who  they
can marry this with netfone by the end of the week? ;-)  Seriously.  I
 someone with real net access and two sparcs could have this running
by the end of the week.  Then we ask the pgp guys to add a bytestream
crypto filter.  Two weeks at the most.  [Damn, I wish I had my sparc
back... I'm stuck on a 25mhz 386sx]


Share and Enjoy!

I've posted some info on CELP coding on sci.crypt.  Looks like you can
squeeze speech into 4000bps if you have a fast enough computer like a
sparcstation (or a Newton with the Acorn Risc Machine in it :-) )

This drops the bandwidth to so low a figure that it's feasible to run
speech over tcp/ip running on top of slip down a v32bis modem.  Not only
will this let us run point to point encrypted speech, it'll let us
run speech internationally over the internet if no-one stops us by
getting *very* heavy about regulations.  The thought of this, if the
administration realised,  probably scare them shitless.

Now of course the trick is to develop and define a standard protocol
for internet speech *damn fast*, allowing anyone who feels brave to
inplement custom handheld hardware as well as us hacking it on our
workstations.  n't be too difficult.  The CELP stuff is standardised,
we use tcp/ip streams, and a protocol allowing silences to be used to
catch up on any net lag, and also to avoid sending any data during
silences (ie it's not wise to be synchronised real-time on each end
because any net delays  add up to big voice-lags)

As for me, I'm going to press ahead on trying this stuff as soon as
I get my sparc back from  loaned out and buy the necessary microphone.
It'll save me a fortune in calling my friend in texas every night :)
(whether encrypted or not)

You know, surely *someone* is working on this.  Who?  It's so obvious,
why doesn't it exist already?  I've only seen netphone for Suns and
it didn't do the CELP compression so was restricted to ether connections.

 the FBI's account of what happened is  contradicted on an
increasingly frequent basis by other officials investigating the
fire, the most pernicious idea of all is believing that Big Brother
is going to be well-behaved with respect to cryptographic keys.

In light of the very serious allegations with respect to the DOJ
selling software to various other intelligence services, what do
you suppose the chances are of some future DOJ selling ed
keys to business firms?

Trusting the government to be honest and fair is putting the 
fox in charge of protecting the chickens.

You  read the history. It was Hoover who stopped Nixon's COINTELPRO
dead in its tracks because he said it was unconstitutional. They tried to
get around him every way they could.

Despite other things he may have done, for this alone, Hoover saved the

The proposal could be modified so that if they get a   to tap you
and  charge you with a crime within, say, 90 days, they have to buy you
a new phone.

If they do charge you, and you are found innocent, they have to buy you a

that differential cryptanalysis can break 16-round Khafre with a chosen-
plaintext attack using 1500 different encryptions.  Khafre with 24 rounds
can be broken with the same attack using 2^53 different encryptions.
( are probably more efficient differential cryptanalytic attacks, if
someone wants to take the time to look.)

Khufu has key-dependent S-boxes, and is immune to differential cryptanalysis.
Source code for this algorithm (and Khafre) are in the patent.

Snefru is a public-domain one-way hash function.  The version of Snefru
that produces a 128-bit hash is vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis
(vulnerable  that the attack is more efficient that brute force) for
four passes or less.  Given that, SHA and MD5 are much more efficient.

Oh yes, anyone interested in licensing the patent  contact Dave Petre,
Director of Patent Licencing for Xerox, (203) 986-3231.

Yes, but will they buy you a ticket on a time machine to allow you to
go back and use the phone with the new key instead of the phone whose
key they obtained?

It is unclear whether obtaining the key at time 0 also unlocks
messages recorded (by whomever) at earlier times. The announcement was
silent on this. The betting seems to be that once your key has been
obtained (by the authorities, by divorce lawyers, by the Mafia, by the
FBI, by lost or stolen backup tapes, by the NSA, etc.). all previous
conversations are unsecure. (Session keys are negotiated, but knowing
the private key is believed by many commentators here to break the
security. No doubt more details will emerge.)

So, the loss of a key, whether one is guilty or innocent, may mean a lot
more than merely replacing the phone.

Sort of like saying to someone, "Oh, I copied your diary. But I'll buy
you a new one."


And the system, if made mandatory (as I expect), will make such
storing of conversations much easier, I fear. For one thing, the
transmission of the  key field acts as a clear signal to anyone
listening, a kind of "Caller ID" and "Callee ID" on a grand scale.
Also, the phone companies may not care as much about protecting the
privacy of the calls, as they perceive them all to be useless
encrypted junk. (This is a bit of a reach, I know, suggesting that the
 will make security more lax...).

Anyway,  lots of issues unresolved.

Perry is right on target here. Caul analysis of the  Chip
announcement reveals that is *not* likely to remain "voluntary" for
very long...the cost of the system, the cost of generating and _then
storing_ the  keys, and the admitted security holes pretty much
make the Phone a loser.

Strong crypto will outcompete it, if strong crypto is allowed. This is
the battle we face.

We had rumblings of this totalitarian key registration thing a 
back, and now the other shoe has dropped. The firestorm of commentary
and criticism this time around reveals the almost immediate revulsion
this Wiretap Chip (and automatic Caller ID and Callee ID, 
forget!) generates in everyone, or almost everyone, who hears about
it.

This is a battle we can't afford to lose.

Do not presume to tell me what I have and have not read.  The system may
not rely upon registering people as owning particular phone units, but
it is necessary to know which phone units are likely to be used for some
suspected criminal communication before you can obtain  unit keys
from .  This necessity raises the stakes in favor of a criminal's
coercing or colluding use of some other person's  phone.

I will restate my assumptions more explicitly and amplify my argument.
The original title perhaps  have been "Distinction between legal
and illegal cipher systems considered harmful", but " considered
harmful" is not inaccurate, and is more eye-catching in the current context.

Assumptions:

  1.   is made available.

  2.  Laws are passed to make use of cipher systems other than  illegal
      (either on radio systems, or on any common carrier system).   laws
      also include enforcement authority to listen across the relevant radio
      spectrum (or other medium), characterize signals, validate 
      wrappers, detect probable use of non- ciphers, and make such
      detection a cause for further action.

  3.  For ed keys to be useful, some specific  chip must be
      associated with a suspected criminal.  This  that at a minimum
      some association between the common carrier's unique phone ID (ESN) and
      the  chip serial number N will be stored in a government database.
      An observed pairing of N and ESN other than the one recorded raises a
      red flag.

  4.  To reduce ordinary fraud, the cellphone system which offers 
      will also be constructed with an ESN mechanism much more tamper-proof
      and much less spoofable than today's cellphones.

  5.  Criminals want inscrutable communications.  Some criminals are not
      entirely stupid or ignorant, and will figure out both that 
      cellphones offer excellent security in normal circumstances, and that
      they offer no security against law enforcement once a (presumably
      legitimate) wiretap  exists.  They will also figure out that the
      wiretap  must necessarily be against a specific cellphone, because
      each one has a unique unit key.

  6.  Criminals do not want to call attention to themselves.  Because they
      are not stupid or ignorant (or because they read netnews), and because
      they know that  open use of a non- cipher is likely to be
      detected, they will generally avoid using non- ciphers directly
      on some monitorable/tappable channel.  They know that do so  raise
      a red flag, putting a given cellphone (if not a given person) under
      immediate suspicion.

  7.  It is impractical to reverse engineer Skipjack, discover family key F,
      and construct a functional clone of a  chip.

By #2, #3, #4, and #7 it will be very difficult to spoof a given 
phone without immediate detection.  Because it is difficult to obscure one's
association to a specific phone by reprogramming or changing chips
around, the criminal will be motivated to find an intact phone which is
associated with someone else.

A non-stupid criminal will conclude that they can have -secure
communications, at least for some limited time T, if they buy, beg, borrow,
or steal use of someone's phone in a way that prevents that person from
reporting compromise of the phone for at least time T.  The encrypted
communications might have been recorded, and thus be retrievable later,
but the criminal can delay, and quite likely evade, discovery by destroying
or abandoning the phone before T elapses.

It  be unusual for an innocent person to volunteer use of  
phone to someone else.  The honest subscriber doesn't want to pay someone
else's bill, and he doesn't want to fall under suspicion.

This leaves two sources of  phones for criminal use: coercion
and collusion.

Coercion first.  Theft bears a relatively low risk, but also sometimes
a low time until detection (a few minutes if a phone is stolen from
a car parked in front of a store, a couple of weeks if a phone is stolen
from someone who is away on vacation).  Criminal commerce is likely to
arise in stolen  phones, with phones coming from risk-inured poor
criminals, and cash coming from risk-averse wealthy criminals.  Someone
who is extraordinarily motivated to gain a day or two of undetected
communication (like a terrorist) could kill a person or hold them hostage.
The limited time (before detection) that a coerced phone is useful 
that continuing criminal enterprises require a continuing supply of
freshly coerced phones.

  also be created a collusive commerce between relatively
wealthy criminals, and ignorant or -care patsies who need money,
and who will submit to  paid in return for subscribing to 
phone service for someone else's use.

Criminals will learn that it is more to  advantage to coerce use of a
 cellphone than it is to apply a non- cipher to a normal
cellphone.  They will call much less attention to themselves (or at least to
 stolen phone) this way.  The fact of a phone's use  coerced must
first be reported before it can be identified as an interesting phone, and
have its keys obtained from .

 also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to
conceal use of super-encryption.  An automated full-system surveillance
mechanism (quite feasible across radio bandwidth) which knows family key F,
can validate  wrappers and N:ESN associations, but it cannot reveal
in realtime the use of super-encryption, unless it knows all unit keys,
which we are  assured are only to be made available in two separate
pieces, upon specific wiretap-like .

Whereas a criminal's use of any cipher within a normally cleartext medium
 stand out, a criminal's use of a non- cipher within a 
medium  be very difficult to detect, even ex post facto in bulk
recordings, as long as the association between criminal and specific 
chip is fractured.

If you make use of this other cipher illegal per se, then you can charge
the criminal with this (if you can identify the true criminal - he'll be
using someone else's phone), but you'll have no evidence to help you against
whatever traditional crime he might have been planning.  You will not even be
able to detect that unusual (encrypted) communications are occurring until you
identify specific phones and obtain  keys from .

The gangster and terrorist are thus arguably more, not less, secure than
they were before  came along.

I theore consider  harmful because:

  1.  It does not provide absolute privacy to the honest public against
      aggressive or dishonest government.

  2.  If other ciphers are proscribed, it engenders new types of direct
      criminal threat to the honest public.

  3.  It provides an extraordinarily effective mechanism for criminals to
      hide  use of some other cipher, making it more difficult than
      ever even to gain notice that unusual communications are occurring
      and that plans for some criminal act might be in progress.

  4.  If other ciphers are proscribed, lazy investigators and prosecutors
      are more likely to pursue the easily quantifiable cipher-use crime
      than they are the traditional and directly harmful crimes which key
       is claimed to help against.

  5.  If other ciphers are proscribed, the stage is set for witch hunting
      of "illegal" cipher use.  Because any computer can be used as a cipher
      machine...

something that no one has discussed yet (or I missed it):

The FBI sets up a wiretap AFTER the   was handed. 
Only at this point they can access the line and detect 
the serial number N.

What happens next, does the FBI simply asks for the keys
for N, and,  a warrant was issued for the line, the FBI 
simply gets it? What if multiple phones are used from the
same house, the FBI just asks for N1, N2, etc.?

Exactly who is to prevent the FBI from claiming some
other serial number, X, was also used over the wirtapped 
line and get the keys for X? 

Either a second   (for the specific serial/key)
is required (and I have seen no indication of this), or
the FBI can effectively ask for any pair of keys at any
time, so the  key holders are a total fake.

An unrelated issue: if and when all phones always use
the  chip, how are call-transfers going to take 
place?!

  Ah, but developing cryptosystems which are specificially designed to
protect the government's domestic spying capabilities takes them beyond
that mandate, into the forbidden field of domestic wiretapping.

	  The points raised about checking what is actually -in- the chip, as
	opposed to what is allegedly programmed in, raise yet another trust
	issue.  Even if we assume that  "trusted agents" are  entering
	a wide range of S1 and S2 seeds (rather than using the same one all the
	time to reduce the key search space to 30 bits), I assume they are not
	doing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry
	at caully selected points to encode data.  They  presumably be
	punching numbers into a computer, which for all they know could program

	are feeding into the system.

S1 and S2 are clearly the backdoor - we  assume they are all
compromised.  If they're not compromisable, why the hell not use a
hardware true random number source.   isn't a random number
source *anywhere* in this proposal.  The whole thing is deterministic
from the day the serial number is stamped on the chip.

Nope, it can't be trusted.  This is all about two levels of access -
the (possibly honest) key  that police forces have to use, and
ostensibly the FBI; and the back door that lets the NSA decode *everything*
on the fly - and maybe some back-handers to the FBI when they want a
warrantless tab in exchange for favours.

You forget the obvious! If it is an *authorised* tap then it can be done at
the exchange. If the exchange is *digital* then I suspect that you can
auto-monitor a line and pickup the full link. Theore syncing a piggyback
modem on the line  not be impossible - I suspect.

	I   mr. Clinton can even understand the technical details of

	If I lived in the USA, I  hope  experts were not paid by the
	<fill here you favorite 3-letter combination>.

"The doctrine of plausible deniability".  No-one is going to tell him
it has a back door.  The NSA will assume he has the sense to work it out
for himself or they n't be pushing it.  Clinton might even *believe*
the NSA when they tell him, for the record, it doesn't have a back door.

And no FOIA request in the world will ever find it.   guys 
play by that set of rules.  They have  own rule book, and no, you're
not allowed to see that either.

I may be misreading you here.  Are you saying the American Revolution 
wasn't a good idea because it was bad odds?

I kind of doubt that any revolution, armed or otherwise, was ever started 
without vast amounts of failed "working within a system".  A good sign of 
a system  not worth preserving  probably be that very inability 
to work within it productively.

Hopefully I've misunderstood.  (BTW, I'm not a big fan of arms myself.

Is the U used in the law enforcement field from the phone which placed the
call, from the unit whose 'start secure session' button was pressed first,
or does each phone transmit its own law enforcement field?  Even assuming
one of the first two choices, the FBI is going to get a fresh N,U for its
own database about every other phone call, eventually accumulating keys for
all the phones used to connect to the line they are monitoring, not just
the 'suspects' key.  (Assuming the ever-thrifty FBI doesn't forget each key
after its wiretap permission has expired.)  Not quite a pyramid, but not
bad, either.

  Good points.  In addition, I  point out that now is one of the
best times to fight this political battle, with much of the opposition
in disarray -- an FBI director (Sessions) on his way out, an Attorney
General (Reno) who has only been in long enough to find the office coffee
machine two tries out of three (and, between slow confirmations and
Clinton's Saturday Night Massacre, hasn't much of a staff in place).
If we  get lucky, both of the above will be too busy trying to
keep  feet from  held to the Waco fire to spend much effort
insisting on  alleged right to spy on the American people.

 TM chip is a registered trademark of Intergraph Corp.

The so-called  chip which was recently mentioned here
and in other media
with respect to encryption is  used in violation of that trademark.  

The Intergraph  chip is a Unix microprocessor, originally 
developed by Fairchild Semiconductors, and has no relationship
to the encryption chip whatsoever.  

I mention this here with the hope that someone reading this will

Hello all,
I thought you all might like to see this. It's a letter from Jerry
Berman to  Chaum from November of 1985, in response to
information that Mr. Chaum sent to Mr. Berman.

 I have to congratulate EFF for its prompt response to the
 Chip announcement from the White House, I  it's important
to recognize the philosophy of  Executive Director, as explained
below.

I agree that legal remedies are important, but when pressed, I'd
per to retain the ability to use purely technical solutions to
preserve my privacy, because they'll hold up under fire.

Mr. Chaum has consented to the publication of this letter on the Net. 

I  work for, nor am I a member of EFF, ACLU, or any similar
s, but I do agree with them on a great many things.

	Thank you for sending me a most interesting .   A
society of  individuals  and  s  that    expend  the
time and resources to use a  series  of  'digital  pseudonyms' to
avoid data linkage does not in my opinion make big brother
obsolete but  acts  on  the  assumption  that  big  brother  is  ever
present.  I  view  your  system  as  a  form  of  societal  paranoia.

	As a matter of  principle,  we  are  working  to  enact  formal
legal protections for  individual  privacy  rather  than  relying  on
technical solutions.   We want to  assume  a  society  of  law  which
respects legal limits rather than  a  society  that  will  disobey  the
law, requiring  citizens  to  depend  on  technical  solutions.  e.g.
require  a  judical  warrant  for  government  interception  of  data
communications rather than  encrypt  all  messages  on  the  assumption
that regardless of the lawt  the  government  will  abuse  its  power
and invade privacy.

	As a  matter  of  practicality,  I  do  not    your  system
offers much hope for privacy.    First, the trend toward universal
identifiers  is  as  much.-a  movement  generated  by  government  or
industry's desire to keep track of all citizens as it is by
citizens seeking simplicity and convenience in all transactions.
At best,  your  system    benefit  the  sophisticated  and  most
 opt for  simplicity.  The  poor  and  the  undereducated  
never use or benefit from it.

	Finally where 's a  will, 's  a  way. If  government
wants to link data bases, it  will,  by  law, require  the  disclosure
of various individual pseudonyms used by citizens or prohibit it
for data bases which the government wants to link.      
corporations  make  money  by  trading  commercial  lists  with   one
another, they will never adopt  the  system  or  if  it  is  adopted,
will use "fine printn  contracts  to  permit  selling  various   codes
used by  customers to other firms.

	The solution remains law, policy, and consensus about limits
on government or corporate intrusion into areas of individual
autonomy.  Technique can be used to enforce that consensus or to
override it. It cannot be used as a substitute for such
consensus.

I posted an informational request about any electronically available
 on cryptographic algorithms a couple of days ago.  As I
mentioned, I was interested, in particular, in DES and Public-Key --
but also n't mind learning about others.  As I said, I can read
an intro-graduate level text book, having had some mathematics, though
not much number-theory per se.  I'd like to see the technical details
of the mathematics of cryptography, as oppossed to the popularizations
of things like _scientific am_ which just say, "then you find a
** big prime number....".

Following my request, several people were so kind as to suggest
reading-lists, which I hope to get around to.  Two other people were
so *very* kind as to send large documents, which I presume were actual
 (about 1000  each); but I've stupidly deleted them
accidentally before having a chance even to skim them.  If they can
forgive me for my careless use of file-commands,  the original
s be so kind as to resend? Or anyone else who has good
crypto- at a fairly technical mathematical level? Also,
ftp-able or gopher-able docs  be nice to know about.

Yours, Lulu...

Then it was either __ good luck or you had some _very_ fast
machine.  DES has 2^56 possible keys, each two of which are simply
to convert into each other, so you have to expect 2^54 trial encryptions
in the mean case, assuming known plaintext.
2^54 / 2 / (24*60*60) / 1000000 is ca. 104250.
So you must have managed to do 104250 encryptions per microsecond.
CE Infosys builds a very fast DES chip that manages 2 (!) encryptions
per microsecond.

Yes, I'm not very seriously bod about the security of DES yet;
though you might per to use triple DES or IDEA, both of which
use more key bits.

nobody@alumni.cco.caltech.edu correctly states Jerry Berman's 1985 view on
privacy, but he mistakenly assumes that this represents Berman's 1993 view as
EFF Executive Director.

As one of the people who convinced Jerry that legal protections for privacy
are insufficient, and that technical measures, especially public key
cryptography, are also vitally necessary, I can tell you that Jerry and EFF
are fully committed to this position.

The previous poster is apparently unaware of a long series of EFF positions in
support of this view.  I suggest  interested read EFF's position on
 or our other work in digital privacy.  Check ftp.eff.org for more
details.

One of the great things about human s is that they are capable of change
and evolution in  ing.  The idea that crypto is critical to privacy
is one which is no longer limited to certain net afficianados, but is 
spreading to parts of the public policy community in Washington.

I can't answer all our questions in detail, but I can take a stab at
them.

The form the operations that compute R1, R2, and R3 is, of course, the
famous ``triple encryption'' suggested for use with DES.  It's much
stronger than a single encryption, and has an effective key length of
160 bits.  For reasons that were discussed when DES was first
standardized, a simple double encryption  not have the same
strength.  Triple encryption has been used by IBM  more or less
the beginning to encrypt other keys.  It's recommended for anything of
very high value.  And I  we can agree that the R_i and S_i fit
that description.

Why n_1, n_2, and n_3?  Well, you need different plaintext values.  I
have no idea if they'll be disclosed or not.  At a guess, they're
constructed so that they differ in as many bit positions as possible.
A goo cryptosystem will scramble things a lot with even a 1-bit change
-- but the values of N in a series will have fairly similar bit
patterns, and  might, conceivably, be a weakness.  So the n_i
values are -- and I'm guessing -- chosen to increase the Hamming
distance.

In any event, I'm quite convinced that one cannot go back to the S_i
from the U_i, let alone U.  (Observe:  if the NSA has U, they 
need to find S_i.  But even if they do, they can't get U_1 and U_2.  In
theory, they  never even see  values, even with a warrant.)

The real question, I , is why use this scheme at all, as opposed
to a hardware random number generator.  My answer is that this is
*much* more verifiable.  Look -- suppose that NSA, NIST, the ACLU, the
EFF, and the NRA combined to build a ** good random number
generator, and that it passed every test you could  of.  When you
come back next week to program some more chips, does it  work that
well?  Have any components changed in value?  Have the components been
changed out from under you?  Does it  work well the in the
presence of a focused microwave beam that tends to bias it towards
selecting 1 bits?  Yes, you can run detailed statistical tests on it
again, but that's hard.

Consider, on the other hand, a software solution.  You bring your own
floppies with you, you can run cryptographic checksums, etc.  It's a
lot easier to verify that the software is unchanged, in other words.
(Yes, I can  of ways to cheat software, too.  I  that they're
a lot harder.)

 are three issues with .  The first is whether or not the
architecture of the whole scheme is capable of working.  My answer,
with one significant exception, is yes.  I  do  that NSA and
NIST have designed this scheme about as well as can be, assuming that
 real objectives are as stated: to permit wiretapping, under
certain caully-controlled circumstances, with a minimum risk of
abuse.  (The exception is that U exists outside of the chip, on a
programming diskette.  That's seriously wrong.  U_1 and U_2  be
loaded onto the chip separately.)  To  who disagree (and I 
claim my answer is obvious, though I found my own reasoning
sufficiently persuasive that I was forced to rewrite the Conclusions
section of my technical analysis paper -- I had originally blasted the
scheme), I issue this invitation:  assume that you were charged with
implementing such a system, with complete regard for civil rights and
due process.  What  you do differently?  In answering this
question, please accept NSA's fundamental assumptions:  that both
strong cryptography against outsiders, and the ability to wiretap
*some* domestic users, is necessary.  (If you feel it necessary to
challenge  assumptions, do it in the context of the last issue I
present below.  Right here, I'm discussing *just* the technical
aspects.  And no, I  by any  claim that just because
something can be done, it  be.)

The second issue is whether or not this whole architecture is actually
going to be used.  Just because  chips are made this way doesn't
mean that that's the only way they'll be made.  Maybe the NSA will
substitute its own chips between the programming facility and the
shipping dock.  And they'll generate bogus warrant requests, so that
the  agents  wonder why they've never called.  (``Sorry,
guys; all them terrorists and drug dealers and pedophiles seem to have
bought triple-DES phones instead.  Who'd 'a' thunk it?'')  I have no
answer to this question, and at the moment, I  see a way of
answering it.   concerns are part of my reasoning in my answer
to the final question, below.

The third, and most serious issue, is whether or not  is a good
idea even if carried out strictly according to the letter of the law.
I  that the answer is no, but it's not a no-brainer.  I'm a civil
libertarian, not a libertarian, for reasons that I explained at great
length on the net in the Elder Days, and that I  have the energy
to repeat now.  But that  that I'm willing to accept that some
laws are necessary, so long as they respect the essential rights of
individuals.  The government already has the ability and -- in our
system -- the right to issue search warrants, and  that power has
certainly been abused, it's also been used quite properly and fairly in
other cases.  Is key  sufficiently different?  I  so -- but
again, it's not an easy question for me.  (It is easy for libertarians
to answer, of course,   is completely alien to much of the
rest of  (oft-admirable) philosophy.  And it's also easy for 
who give  unreserved trust to government, a group I'm much more
distant from.)

Don Alvarez posted a good partial solution to this problem to
comp.risks.  I'll present my variant on it instead,  I feel it's a
bit stronger against some likely attempts to cheat.  depends on the
protocol that's followed for reading traffic.  Briefly, the cops get a
wiretap warrant, and record the call.  They then notice the encryption
and the disclosure header.  It, along with a copy of  warrant, is
sent to the FBI, or whoever it is who holds the family key.  The
F-holder decrypts the header, and sends the serial number N and the
encrypted session key U[K] to the  agents.  They, in turn, use U1
and U2 to recover K, and send that to the local police.

Note how this solves the problem of wiretapping forever.  Neither the
cops nor the FBI ever see U, so they can't read other traffic.  Every
request must be validated by both the FBI and the  agents.  The
cops and the FBI together can't cheat,  they  have U.  (I
regard that as a likely pairing of folks who might try to beat the
system.  It's to prevent this that I modified Alvarez's scheme.)  The
 agents can't read the conversation,  they  have it;
all they have is N and U[K].  And the police  even see N.

It's harder to see how to block decryption of old, warrantless,
wiretaps.   is one protection -- you have to persuade the 
agents that the call is current.  But that's not nearly as strong.
 are approaches I can see that might work, involving sequences of
data on an unalterable medium, complete with cryptographic protection
against insertion onto a new medium.  But I  have anything yet
that isn't too complex for comfort, or too hard to install in the real
world.  The NSA might have an answer; they may or may not be smarter
than me, but I've been working on this for a week, and they've had years.

Brad Yearwood posts a long response to the issue of registering a
phone- relationship.

It doesn't wash.

Recall that law enforcement gets a   to tap a suspect's phone
calls. They do what they do now--figure out which  to tap. They then
record the stuff. If it's , they read the law enforcement block,
extract the serial number, and get the keys using the  .

No new difficulties (such as using someone else's phone instrument or phone
line) are introduced that n't have existed absent . If the
crooks were going to use a pay phone (say), they could have done so without
. If the government figures out they're so doing, they listen in, and
if it's a  conversation they get the serial number and then the keys.

If the crooks use an innocent person's  phone on the tapped line
's no problem. The Feds  care whose phone instrument is used, just
that the conversation is by the suspect on the tapped line. They get the
serial number, get the keys, and they are in business.

No  chip to person association is ever needed.

Though I  this an overstatement, it does contain a grain of truth. It's
drug dealers, spies, terrorists, and organized crime figures (assuming
enough probable cause to convince a judge) who need to be watched, not
law-abiding citizens.

I  it very unlikely  are back doors in , for two reasons:

1. The government doesn't need them if it can get the key (and yes, I assume
that the "official" government obeys  s, etc.--and that the design
of the chip and its approval were "official");

2. It  defeat the whole purpose of providing secure crypto for American
business that couldn't be read by our economic adversaries. If this were not
a legitimate and genuine purpose, and as many , the NSA can read DES,
why bother otherwise?

Rational responses perred to conspiracy theories, thanks.

Two safeguards:

1. The FBI could be asked to produce the law enforcement block to the 
agencies, and associate it with a particular  ;

2. If the thing comes to trial the defense attorneys can probe this issue
closely. It is not too different from proving that the speaker on a legal
wiretap is the person the   covered.

Putting it another way, this question is not very different from the
pre- question "What's to prevent the FBI from getting a  
to tap Al Capone and then using it to tap Jonathan Livingstone Seagull
instead?"

Doesn't matter if we assume they are obeying the law,  they won't have

thus won't have them available.

If they aren't obeying the law, we are in an entirely different discussion,

   It was implied in the first technical posting by Dorothy Denning that the
FBI  do the decryption *for* the law enforcement agencies.  It wasn't
clear to me from the post whether this  be done in realtime or not, or
whether the FBI  just decrypt the session keys for the locals, or 
do the whole message.
 
   One thing I'm a bit puzzled by:  Why aren't they doing this with a public
key scheme of some sort?  You could generate two uniqe public/private pairsor
for each chip.  Then,  the private keys with the  agencies.  Set
the protocol up to encrypt the session key with both public keys.  To decrypt
a message, both  agencies (in the right , for most PK schemes)
have to decrypt with the ed private key.  This way,  n't be
thecconcern that, once the police had asked fo  a warrant/wiretap, they
 have your key forver.

Steve Bellovin  a well-thought-out and nearly persuasive  about
why the  (are we  calling it  today, or have they figured
out a non-infringing word yet?) protocol is almost as good as one can do
given  marching ordes.

In  <4.160121.17189@ulysses.att.com> smb@research.att.com (Steven Bellovin) :
>         I issue this invitation:  assume that you were charged with

I'll accept the second assumption only for the sake of argument.  In my
view the primary remaining flaw is that the encryption algorithm is
secret, leading to suspicion that  is a back door.  Without complete
disclosure this suspicion cannot be dispelled, no matter how many trusted
experts are allowed to look at it in isolation.

Is it possible to do this whole thing with a public algorithm?  The only
concern I've seen with making Skipjack public is that someone could build
phones without registering the keys.  Assume F can  be kept
secret as the Government assumes.  Then as part of the initial connection,
a phone executes a protocol with the Pseudophone to demonstrate
that they both know F.  For example, the initiating phone picks a number Q
and sends E[Q; F].  The receiver sends back E[Q+1; F], and the initiator
sends back E[Q+2; F] to demonstrate that her first packet wasn't just a
random 64-bit block.  Repeat in the opposite direction with another Q so
it can't be defeated by somebody building up a library of sequential
numbers by remembering responses and using  responses as the initial
numbers of subsequent challenges.  This way phones will talk only
to other phones.  Of course the Pseudo Company can build  own
proprietary Skipjack phone, but the Presidential Fact Sheet implies that
they won't get approval for it without equivalent key .

What's wrong with this picture?  It depends of F staying secret and on
Skipjack  resistant to cryptanalysis, but the Government appears to
believe in both of .  Even if the particular Q&A I suggest has some
flaw, I imagine 's a zero-knowledge-proof protocol that doesn't.

smb says:
>The third, and most serious issue, is whether or not  is a good

Agreed.  My view, and you can quote me: if it's not worth doing, it's
not worth doing well.

   is a description of something called a "fair crypto system" in the
May 1993 issue of BYTE, p. 134, attributed to MIT professor Silvio Micali.

  The way it works is as follows:

  You generate your private key S, and break it up into pieces s1, s2, s3,
s4, and s5, such that (s1 + s2 + ... + s5) mod p = S.
  You give each piece s1, s2, etc. to a different  agency.
  The agencies each compute g^sn mod p, and forward the result to the public
key telephone book keeper.
  The public key telephone book keeper multiplies all the g^sn mod p, reduces
the result to mod p, and this will be the user's public key.

  Now, if  were several hundered recognized  agencies, and the user
could give a piece of the key to each of the ones he trusted, the result 
be something of an improvement over the proposed  system.

  I    key  is a good idea, for both philosophical and
security reasons, but I do offer this suggestion simply to determine whether
 advocates are at all interested in considering alternatives in good
faith, or whether the goal is to insure the use of only two agencies selected
for spinelessness in the face of official requests.

  So, you admit that  opens the doors wide for the following scenario:

  FEDS: We need the keys to Joe Blow's phone.

   AGENT: Joe Blow?  You have a warrant to tap his line?

  FEDS: Well, no, but we have a warrant to tap Carlos "Slime-Devil" Gonzales'
     line, and our tap shows that Mr. Gonzales is using Mr. Blow's phone.

   AGENT: Well, OK....

Yeah, but who wants to start a pool on the first person arrested
mistakenly and has  life turned upside-down because some law
enforcement agency *does* make a chip::person association?

I wonder if  are any plans to keep  records (e.g. encode the
serial number into the UPC scanned at K-Mart along with the credit
card info, voila.)

At least your phone number tends to only locate to your house or
whatever (i.e. to be coming from your telephone number the person
likely is in your house etc.), plus or minus some shenanigans of
course.

But I'd hate to  of  guys getting the  id, recording
the conversation, then doing a quick cross-lookup and your name comes
up as owner of that id (mistakenly, maybe you sold the phone at a
garage sale or the phone was stolen from your car or whatever.) They
might only know who one side of the conversation is, for example.

Anyone who s the govt is forbidden by law to cross-correlate such
databases loses two points. First, law enforcement agencies can of
course do this. Second, they're only forbidden from BUDGETING any
money for it. The IRS, for example, does do this anyhow. They just
 spend any money on it so it's (technically) legal I guess.

Instead they probably trade little favors with companies like
mastercard (if you're the IRS I'll bet you have a *lot* of
opportunities to trade favors with major corps for  databases.)

I know, an IRS guy read an amazing list off to me (from his screen, I
could hear him typing to pull up each screen) once on the phone during
a dispute I had with them (to intimidate me, actually, not much of a
dispute, I didn't particularly disagree, but for some reason this
fellow wanted to play tough guy with me, I hope he's better now.)

Amazing stuff he had at his finger tips. Be afraid.

It is completely clear. You have to assume that each byte that was encrypted
by this ' Chip' has been compromised. 
Some people wondered, why Denning, Hellman and others did not respond,
when asked what  be done about such compromised phones, or if
compromise could not be restricted in time. (I did too) Let us just assume
that a) They do not know and b)  who know  tell and c)
They do not care. It seem's to be an 'Other Person's Problem' ...

The Shannon limit for voice  is likely somewhere around 25kbps.
We are rapidly approaching it. The fastest affordable full-duplex
modems currently on the market are V32bis, which is 14400bps.

>How far can voice be compressed?

CELP manages to sound decent at 4800 bps.

In theory, if you built a speech recognition system that turned voice
into ASCII, and a perfect synthesis system on the other end that
sounded just like the person you were speaking to, you could get it
down to the information content of the speech.

With various kinds of LPC, you can get it down to 2400 bps or prehaps
even less, at which point it sounds horrible.

4800 bps is more than adequite for our purposes.

As I've noted, you can likely get around that with a directional

True, but the basic idea behind any communications security system is not
to absolutely deny access, but to make access more expensive (in time,
money, manpower) than it is worth.

   Neither (1) or (2) apply with the government, though. The feds, unlike
Apple, have repeatedly demonstrated that trust is an unsafe thread on which
to hang your freedom. Why?  Because unlike Apple in (2), the govt has no
credibility to lose. I'm serious about this. One can name just about any
agency -- the IRS, RTC, FCC, FAA, FBI, NSA, CIA -- and find numerous examples
of the public trust run roughshod over. Worse, one can rarely find in such 
examples any serious consequences to the offending agency. Even supposing
we could get a reign on trust somehow, 's always the matter of competence
in govt agencies. Can they even trust themselves?

No no no no no no no.

It will go like this:

FEDS: We need the key to phone 334RE67D99.

: You have a warrant to tap the line phone 334RE67D99 is on?

FEDS: Yes.

: Fine, here is our key.

What happens is, Feds tap a line; find  is  used; extract
serial number; get key; decipher convo.  The serial number is never
registered to a specific owner, it is _sent_ as part of the
conversation.  If I give you my  phone, you do not need to

As I read the current wiretap law, it  not be legal now.  On the
other hand, assuming a legislative change, recording but not decrypting
 conversations  probably be found constitutional by the Supreme
, using the same reasoning (or the lack of...) by which they
permit random roadblocks to check for drunk drivers.

Incidentally, if we use that as our model, the  will likely not
uphold selective recording.  (On the other hand, I   they've
thrown out ``drug courier profiles'' yet.  Must be that exception to
the Fourth Amendment that I can never find in my copy of the Bill of
Rights.)

A lot -- and I mean a *lot* -- will depend on exactly how taps
(or Tipperclaps, for encrypted music?) are used.  Don Alvarez showed in
the latest RISKS digest that it's possible to prevent the cops from
reading traffic after  warrant expires.

That is -- the cops send the LEF to the F-holder.  The F-holder strips
off F, and sends U[K],N to the  agents.  They send either U or K
to the cops.  (Don says U, I say K.)  The cops can't use U in the
future, because they can't strip off F.  The F-holder never sees U.  In
Don's model, the  agents can't read the traffic, because they
 have K; in my model, they have K, but not the message itself.
And I trust that more because I  the cops and the FBI (the
F-holder) are more likely to collaborate on breaking the rules.  The
net result is that by involving the F-holder and the  agents on
every tap, we can avoid extending permission to tap.

   I disagree strongly with you on the issue of our trusting the government,
I  you have a good idea here.  is danger that, with funding coming
from asset forfeitures, the government could continue to promulgate a bad
product in spite of poor acceptance. Making the product pay its way (as
it must for private ventures)  be a good incentive for quality and
listening to we, the ranters. :)

Another idea: Use a laptop computer.  As mentioned earlier, the LCD screen
is a lot less noisy than a standard CRT, but  many laptops have power
supplies that run at 3 volts instead of 5, they  be considerably 
quieter.

The whole point of the  system is to prevent the FBI from making 
illegal wiretaps. Why not have the FBI holds the
keys and that's it? Why do we need the  system at all?

Unless a 3rd party (a judge) verifies that the requested serial number
is "right", and the FBI can get any key they like at anytime, the 
system is useless.

Yeah, right, and if the ATF trashes your place on a bad tip they have

confisticated in a raid they have to charge you with a crime within,

large sums of money our legitimate co.s provide to  campain coffers. We
 also let them know via the 'other' channels that a)  income is about
to take a hit, and b)  health may not be too good either.

But just in case, the next obvious step to take is to BUY Mycotoxic and VLSI!
Yeah, free enterprise at work. :-) Now they have the Cripple in  pockets,
literaly as well as figurativly. Tough about the masses though.

: PGP Where to get it?

        I am both new to this news group and to the net.
        
        I am facinated by the things I have heard about the PGP
encryption program.  Does anybody out  know where I might get a
version of this program that runs under Windows 3.1, MS-Dos, Unix
w/source?  As of this writting I have no UNIX access and am running on a
nifty windows implamentation of uucico.
        Thanks in advance!

The problem is that this will also cause  "a certain amount of interference"
in *all* systems within the range of the device.  A long time ago I built a
small jammer to dissuade my brother from using his radio alarm clock at 
something like 4am, which had just enough range to cover my room and his.
However something powerful enough to mask all (or at least most) emissions from
your computer equipment is also going to knock out half your neighbourhoods
radio and TV reception.  This isn't going to make you many friends.

Incidentally, an older-model TRS80 makes a fine wideband jammer <grin>

Then Xerox patented the algorithms.  <Plonk!>

   It's not , it's any encryption system.  I've seen a number of
   designs; they generally involve a multi-line cleartext bridge.

Depending on the encryption system, so long as everyone has the same
key, it can be done.  For example, I was using "vat", which is an
Internet Audio tool, for a conference call, and we were encrypting the
session.  (Unfortunately, one site was doing more work, and didn't
have the CPU for it, so it didn't sound all that good at a different
site)

So, you  neccessarily have to have a clear-text bridge.  But if
you do, its totally internal to one of the sites involved in the
conversation....

I tried this code yesterday.  On my Sparcstation ELC it takes over
300 seconds to compress 22 seconds' worth of speech.  This  that it
needs to be "optimized" by over a factor of 10 before it will be usable
in even a half-duplex mode.

I question whether CELP is the best approach for this application.  It produces
great compression but at the expense of tremendous CPU loads.  We want
something that can be run on ordinary workstations or even high-end PC's
without DSP cards.  My guess is that some other algorithm is going to be
a better starting point.

My interpretation of Denning's description is that S1 and S2 are chosen
randomly by agents of the key  companies at the start of each 300-
chip programming session.  I imagine that the chips are in a carrier which
will allow them all to be programmed fairly quickly -   not be
a need to transfer chips one at a time into a little PLA programmer as some
people have envisioned.

My guess as to why this procedure is used is that basing the keys on the
S1 and S2 using a specified algorithm provides an (in-principle) checkable
way to verify that no back doors exist in the choice of the random numbers
used to generate the keys.   we have to trust the  companies
anyway, it does not weaken the system to have the keys be generated from
random seeds entered by the  agents.  And  the algorithm for
key-generation is public (modulo Skipjack secrecy) then in principle an
agent could challenge the procedure, ask for S1 and S2 to be exposed, and
run his own independent calculation of U1 and U2 to verify that that is
what is actually  put onto the floppies.

And yes,  are many ways in which failures to follow this scheme could
be hard to check.  The laptop probably will not  be destroyed each
time.  Hidden cameras in the ceiling could see the S1 and S2 entered by
the trusted  agents.  Back doors in the chip could allow U to be
recovered.  Heck, each chip could be recorded with the same U, ignoring
what was on the floppy.

       The classic comment on new encryption algorithms comes from
Friedman:

	"No new cypher is worth considering unless it comes 
	from someone who has already broken a very hard one."

Historically, Friedman has been right.  It's  hard to develop
a good cypher.  IBM's Lucifer, the precursor to DES, turns out to have
been fatally flawed.  Most of the DES-like systems other than DES seem
to be vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis.  The first two tries at
public key encryption (remember knapsack cyphers?) were broken.  Most
if not all of the machine cyphers of the electromechanical era were
broken eventually.  Attempts in the computer era to home-brew encryption
have been disappointing; the classic "A survey of data insecurity packages"
in Cryptologia contains analyses and breaking techniques for a few of the
popular "security packages" of the late 1980s.

        A new, proprietary algorithm?  No way.

        If the US is permitting general export of this thing, it has
to be weak; that's how the current regulations work.  Currently 's
a willingness to allow systems with short keys (32 bits appears to be
no problem; the 56 bits of DES are too many) or weak algorithms
(I  Word Perfect qualifies under that rule) to be exported.
I can't believe  guys shepherded  technique through the 
PTO and the State Department's Arms Control Division without finding that out.

					John Nagle

p.s. No, I'm not thrilled with  either, but that's a different issue.

Yes.  I'm not sure if my xposting to comp.speech made it to here too, but
I've found that a low sample rate (3300 samples/sec at 8 bits per sample)
plus the pd 'shorten' lossless sound compression code actually does get
speech into 14.4K with a simdgen left over.  This is *definitely* worth
working on, folks.  And shorten works in well under real-time.

I've been reading this board passively for a  now and find the
 absolutely fascinating, especially from the point of view of
a civil rights nut like myself.  My problem is that I'm new to the field
and paragraphs like the above keep popping up.  I'm sure what Mr. 
Bellovin is writing about is both fascinating and important, but I have 
NO IDEA what it .  :-)   
  
  Anyway I'm keen to learn and will read anything I can get my hands on
that explains this stuff in lay terms (I have a decent CS background, but
not a huge amount of hyper-advanced math).  Can anyone point me to a FAQ
or a decent source of information about the guts of current cryptography and
maybe a little history as well?  I read the piece in this month's WIRED, can
anyone tell me how much I  trust the  they suggest?

  Thanks in advance,
   Steve.

I did.  You're mistaken.  NSA's communications intelligence mission is
strictly against foreign governments.  Here's an excerpt from the enabling
charter (24 Oct 52, Truman) that  clarify this.  The charter was
declassified in about Feb 1990 when an FOIA request made it public.  Mind
you, I  know that they never collect anything they're not supposed
to... but spying on US citizens isn't in  charter.

    b. The COMINT  mission of the National  Security Agency
	(NSA) shall be to provide an effective,  unified 
	and control of the communications  intelligence activities of
	the United States  conducted against foreign  governments, to
	provide for  integrated operational  policies and  procedures
	pertaining to.   As  used in  this directive,  the terms
	"communications intelligence"  or "COMINT" shall be construed
	to mean all  procedures and methods used in  the interception
	of communications  other  than foreign  press and  propaganda
	broadcasts  and  the  obtaining  of   information  from  such
	communications by other  than intended recipients,  but shall
	exclude censorship  and the  production and dissemination  of
	finished intelligence.

They're also tasked with protecting the US's communications, but I haven't
seen the specific enabling memo on that.  I assume that's the role under
which Skipjack was developed.

NSA is not in the standard-setting business, though -- that's why this
 stuff came from NIST, which I believe is tasked with coming up
with standards based on  best inputs from other government agencies,
which  include NSA.

	I   that this  be worked on just in the context
of cryptography. That's sure to pose all sorts of problems for all sorts
of people.

	What's needed is for someone to develop a portable telephone
quality speech<->RS232 converter. Imagine, if you will, a little box that
takes data on its serial port and puts out sound, and takes sound and codes
it to signals on its serial port. Full duplex. Now, this device is not a
cryptographic device. It's a portable poor man's sound blaster or whatever
you want to call it. It's got loads of perfectly legitimate applications
for:
	a) speech synthesis (with a few nifty libraries and some samples)
	b) speech recording for electronic messaging
	c) building voicemail systems
	d) internet talk radio
	e) internet relay chat

	Of course, some of the electronic messaging in item b might be
encrypted, possibly realtime, but that's the user's decision. One 
need 2 of  talky boxes and a pair of modems and some kind of cutout
to switch over, and some code on, say, a 486 laptop.

	I'd  like to see such a thing developed so that interactive
internet talk radio could be done. Ideally, though, it  be a general
purpose device. It  be a general purpose enough device that nobody
 be able to balk at its widespread use. Obviously, to make it easy
for homebrewers, it  use pretty common hardware.

	It's interesting to note that I'd already talked with a couple
of folks about building such a thing, before this whole  thing
started. I even went so far as to track down a couple of folks who are
able to make sample units, given incentive and some time. I'd envisioned
finding a couple of folks interested in such a project and helping fund
development of a public domain board layout and parts set, that could
be published in the form of CAD drawings for a couple of major CAD
packages, and in PostScript.

	Anyone interested? I'll start a provisional mailing list. Let
me know if you want on.

Okay, it looks like I am going to have to do the history lesson after all.

During the Vietnam war,  were a great many citizens opposed to it
who considered themselves perfectly law abiding, although Mr. Nixon and
his lackeys thought otherwise.

The Federal government had no compunction about adding "people who
are otherwise decent, law abiding and upstanding, but disagree with
us" to your nice little list. Do you  this could never happen
again?

Note that I am not speculating about what the government could do,
but discussing the sort of "observation" - including but not limited
to phone tapping - that the government put its citizens under during
a time of national tension.

Your naivete is  appalling, BTW. I mean, read what you posted again.
How are we to differentiate between Good People and Bad People? Answer:
A priori, we can't; we have to assume. Now, which way do we assume? Do
we assume a priori that a citizen is law-abiding, or rather a potential
CommunistDrugLordChildAbuserCultMessiah? One of the things that's
supposedly great about America is the freedoms enjoyed by citizens who
are presumed to be law-abiding until proven otherwise.

The problem is, the people are not having the scope, or implicataions

when they do, it will be in soothing language telling everyone how
nice the government is at 'letting them have' privacy.

How come the media is not telling about the provisions of the 
decision?  The provisions of the Crime Bill?  The abuses of Civil Forfeiture?
The government uses polls to support 75 percent of the people want
gun bans, etc., yet the same pollsters have determined (according to
the media) that 30 percent of the people are unaware of what the Holocaust
is...

The people cannot be expected to give decent decisions when they are
denied the information that all  abuses and whittling away of
rights are going on quietly.  When they find out (when it hits them),
it will be too late.  One cannot expect each citizen to spend all 
time probing, searching, researching, etc.   For example, how big a
percentage of the average population even has access to USENET?  Way
less than 1 percent, I bet.   How many outside of Internet/USENET
are even AWARE of what Big Brother is doing, or have been exposed to
arguments of both sides of the issue?

What the public will get is only ONE side:  The Government's side.

>Ouch!  Thanks for trying it.

The following program is a very quick hack I created a few months
ago to determine whether a Sun Sparcstation IPC could perform
real-time, full-duplex encrypted audio with resulting data rates
sustainable by today's modems.

This test program reads linearly-encoded audio from the audio device,
compresses it with GSM 06.10 (compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples
recorded at 8kHz into 260 bits resulting in a 50 Hz frame rate), encrypts
it with DES, then reverses the process and sends the reconstructed audio
back to the audio device.  The compressed, encrypted audio stream
is 13 kbits/s (!).

My Sparcstation IPC (not exactly a very fast machine  days,
certainly slower than an ELC)  just barely sustain this activity
(audio underruns  occcur but the speech was very intelligible).  I
ran it as a real-time process to get the best results.  Remember,
though, that this program is a quick hack and the performance can
certainly be improved.

The audio compression routines can be ftp'd from tub.cs.tu-berlin.de,
I believe (look for gsm or toast).  I used Eric Young's DES
implementation but I no longer know where I got it from.

The answer to your second question lies in the way you phrased the

The medis isn't 'is'.  The media 'are'.  'Media'  'more than one

April 19, 1993

The Honorable Ronald H. Brown
Secretary
Department of Commerce
14th and Pennsylvania Ave., NW
Washington, DC 20236

Dear Secretary Brown:

   As you know, I have long been interested in the privacy 
and security of telecommunications transmissions and data in 
a networked environment.  Recent reports concerning the 
Administration's endorsement of an electronic encryption 
standard, based upon " chip" technology, have raised a 
number of related issues.  The international competitiveness 
of U.S. high tech manufacturers and the software industry is 
a key factor that the government  consider when 
addressing issues of encryption and data security.  As the 
nation moves forward in developing the national 
communications and information infrastructure, security of 
telecommunications transmissions and network data will be an 
increasingly important factor for protecting the privacy of 
users.

   The "hacker" community can compromise the integrity of 
telecommunications transmissions and databases linked by the 
network.  The people and businesses that use the nation's 
telecommunications network and the personal computers linked 
through it increasingly are demanding that information be 
protected against unauthorized access, alteration, and theft.

   I am concerned that the Administration's plan may mean 
that to remain competitive internationally, U.S. companies 
 be compelled to develop two products -- one for U.S. 
government customers, and another for private, commercial 
users who may want a higher encryption standard.  This may 
inadvertently increase costs to  U.S. companies hoping 
to serve both markets.  To assist the Subcommittee's analysis 
of this issue, please respond to the following questions:

1. Has the encryption algorithm or standard endorsed by the 
Administration been tested by any entity other than NSA, NIST 
or the vendor?  If so, please identify such entities and the 
nature of testing performed.  If not, please describe any 
plans to have the algorithm tested by outside experts and how 
such experts will be chosen.

2. Under the Administration's plan, what entities will be the 
holders of the "keys" to decrypt scrambled data?  What 
procedures or criteria will the Administration utilize to 
designate such key holders?

3. Does the encryption algorithm endorsed by the 
Administration contain a "trap door" or "back door," which 
could allow an agency or entity of the Federal government to 
crack the code?

4. It is clear that over time, changes in technologies used 
for communications will require new techniques and additional 
equipment.  How will encryption devices adapt to the rapid 
advancement of telecommunications technology?

5. What additional costs  the proposed encryption place 
on the Federal government?  What is the estimated cost to 
consumers and businesses which opt for the federal standard 
in  equipment?

6. What is the Commerce Department's assessment of the 
competitive impact of the Administration's endorsement of the 
" chip" technology on U.S. exports of computer and 
telecommunications hardware and software products?

   I  appreciate your response by no later than close-
of-business, Wednesday, April 28, 1993.  If you have any 
questions, please have your staff contact Colin Crowell or 
Karen Colannino of the Subcommittee staff at (202) 226-2424.

rely,

Edward J. Markey
Chairman

I want to add link encryption to a module that multiplexes upper
level routines into a single data link. The upper levels won't know
about this, and thus key exchange shall only need to occur once (at
the initial link establishment). I figure that I can do this with
DES and a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

Is using a Diffie-Hellman exchange to establish a 64 bit DES key
acceptable, in other words, what are the pro's and con's of such a 
setup? Are  any important issues to watch out for (aside from
filtering out unacceptable keys)?

And in  to achieve this, I guess I will need to use 64bit math
routines (for probable prime number calculation, exponentiation etc),
so could someone point me towards a good package (this is strictly
non-commercial).

     Why  we move down even further toward the masses by setting this
up on an IBM PC clone(probably needs to be a 386 or a 486) with a 
sound blaster and a V.32bis modem.   components are very widely
available.  I  know if the PC has enough horsepower to encrypt the data
at realtime, but the sound blaster has 4 to 1 hardware compression and will
work at any sampling rate from 4KHz to 23 KHz.

Glenn,

Thanks for posting that.  I was surprised to notice, however, that one
question I might have expected to be asked was not:  "Are all forms of
strong encryption other than the  to be made illegal?"  Speaking
of which, is anyone aware of whether that question *has* been asked of
any knowledgeable or official spokesperson for the government?  I have
not yet seen it mentioned in any of a dozen places it might have been
reported, but I could have easily missed it.

    The NSA's charter forbids them from doing any purely domestic
intelligence work, I   that even providing assistance in
development of the Skipjack algorithom is a violation of that charter. 
But as with any intrenched government agency, they will do what they
 is expedent.

   I did.  You're mistaken.  NSA's communications intelligence mission is
   strictly against foreign governments.  Here's an excerpt from the enabling
   charter (24 Oct 52, Truman) that  clarify this.  The charter was
   declassified in about Feb 1990 when an FOIA request made it public.
Interesting!  Where can I get the whole thing?

   NSA is not in the standard-setting business, though -- that's why this
    stuff came from NIST, which I believe is tasked with coming up
   with standards based on  best inputs from other government agencies,
   which  include NSA.

Several of the newspaper reports have made it fairly clear that the
NSA did all the real work.  You can't believe everything you read in
the papers :-), but the package of information the NIST is faxing out
has so little information beyond what's widely known that it sounds
like it's true.

I found the personal attacks on Prof. Denning pretty disgusting.
I  agree with all her positions; but I  scholars can
disagree without the argument getting into the gutter.

If  personal attacks are what stopped Prof. Denning from
replying on issues of substance, they have cause real harm
to the serious debate here.

Here is how! Lets write a DOCUMENT which includes all the reasons
we oppose , in clear, concise, non-techincal manner. I urge 
everyone of you to take the (very simple) "start" below and repost it
with changes. Let the text evolve until we reach something most of us
like. Then, all of you  send a copy (with a personnel letter)
to your congress critter, local reporter on sci/tech, etc.

Please, to make this a success, try to post only an "agreed" version,
not flames. To respond to a flame to this, please change the 
to, e.g, " scope - discussion".

What is wrong with the  chip - By usenet users
-----------------------------------------------------

1) It is secret. 
2) How can we trust the  agencies?
3) It is not cost-effective
4) We want other encryption systems, the government seems to want to
   disallow it in the future
5) Anyone can build a non-key system
6) We are worried about a back door
7) Once everyone uses a  chip, the mechanism for a Big-Brother
   government is in place, a change of government can lead to it. 
   Especially  the  agencies operation is not governed by
   law (so the president can change the rules to allow free access to
   the keys at any time, e.g., during war)
8) Few criminals are caught by wiretaps, the cost [and risks] are unjustified
9) Once the FBI get hold of a key, it can decrypt past and future conversations

        And just were  you put that bridge?  If it isn't at one of
the receiptants location, forget encryption at all.  You have blown any

This doesn't work, due to the near-field far-field effect. You may stop
someone five yards away from listening in, but someone fifty yards away will
be relatively unaffected - unless you pump out hundreds of watts and jam all 
the neighbourhood TV's as well. In that case the government will stomp on you -
ask any radio ham! Democratic governments care even more about  voters' 
right to watch soap operas than they do about national security, and dictators 
consider  propaganda to be an integral part of  national security.

I'm afraid this doesn't work either. We can pick up laptop screens without any
problem.

Most of the so-called `low radiation' monitors are also useless. The description
turns out to a marketing assertion rather than an engineering one.

We thought  might be a market for a monitor which was not as hugely
expensive as the military Tempest kit, but which was well enough shielded to
stop eavesdropping using available receivers. We built a prototype, it works,
and it's  sitting on my lab bench. Commercial interest was exactly zero.

In the absence of open standards, a monitor which  is `low radiation'
(and costs 500 dollars more) can't compete against a monitor which just
claims to be `low radiation' (and whose only extra cost of production is the
pretty blue sticker on the box).

We had a senior NSA scientist in Cambridge at one of our workshops recently
(in fact he was here when the  announcement was made, but we didn't
learn of it till after he'd gone). He said on this point that he was forbidden
by law to monitor conversations between US nationals (and he is a chap who is 
very precise about his choice of words). So I  expect he'd have any qualms
about monitoring a domestic US conversation if one of the parties was an alien.

However it got me ing of the Navajo code talkers. Just imagine:

In 1967, when I was a grad student at UW in Seattle I had a chance to 
read Hoover's book "Masters of Deceit", and I quote a sentence (from 
memory):

"and beware my fellow Americans, a communist may look just as an 
ordinary person..."

I went to the mirror and it was true.

 are other laws and directives which bear upon the .  For
example, the National Computer Security Act of 1987 specifically directs
NBS [sic] to work with NSA on developing security standards for civilian
Federal computers.  (Pick up the bill from cpsr.org; it also includes
a report describing it, and some of the legislative history, including
concerns about NSA's involvement.)  Note also that NSA is specifically
charged with running the National Computer Security Center,  -- to
quote the aforementioned report -- ``NSA also will work with industries at
the DOD Computer Security Center to develop security standards for private
sector use.''

It may or may not be a good idea to have NSA tinkering with this, but
I'm pretty sure it's legal.  (Btw -- when it comes to development of
cryptosystems,  may be two choices.  Either NSA helped develop it,
in which case maybe they can crack it, maybe not, but probably, no one
else can; or NSA didn't help, in which case they probably can crack it,
and maybe others as well...)

The serial number will be in a 64 bit block, with a 34 bit filler.  Doesn't

  The "low radiation" claims one sees on monitors  days pertain to
allegedly harmful electromagnetic emissions, which does not necessarily have
anything to do wtih TEMPEST security.

Motorola certainly makes them, but I  know how you
 go about buying one.  You'd probably have to buy one
of our secure radios.  

You could also bring in encryption chips from outside the country.

It depends on the mode you're using.  For a single 64-bit input block, a
one-bit error will have a 50 percent chance of corrupting each of the 64
output bits - in other words, it essentially turns the output block into
a random number.  If you're encrypting data in CBC mode, however, only the
one 64-bit block will be affected.  The next block, and all that follow it
will be decrypted properly.

It's a good idea to have some kind of error correction in your system if
corrupted bits are likely.

    Maybe you are using the wrong amendment.  If someone were to seize
a safe containing your (paper) records, and demand that you produce
the combination, the applicable defense  be on grounds of
unreasonable search and seizure.  The police  be entitled to
subpoena documents relating to a specific matter, but any broad search
such as implied by impounding all your records  be unconstitutional.
In the case of the safe, they  probably get a locksmith and
assert that they ONLY examined documents covered by the warrent.
(Sure!)  In the cryptographic case,  only resort  be
rubber-hose cryptography.

    (This  also make a good "mental experiment" to use in
choosing  agents.   you trust this proposed agent with a
key to your hard disk?--or half the key for that matter.)

Suppose instead that S1 and S2 can be reconstructed given 3 or 4 of the
unit keys generated in a single batch (through some sort of known
plaintext attack, say).  Suppose further that 3 or 4 of the chips
programmed in each session never find  way into commercial
products, but instead end up "elsewhere".

Suppose the folks at "elsewhere" can determine a unit key, given
physical access to one of  chips.  Then  same folks can

Too many suppositions?  Yeah, probably.

Please let us know if you get a solid answer to the question of legality
of other strong cryptosystems.   So far any  I have seen
have been weasel-words ("more plans in the future, etc"), but nothing
that could be taken as a "NO (strong crypto will NOT be outlawed)".  I
have heard (not verified) that the Crime Bill before Congress has
language that either requires  of keys, or that will regard
all systems 'unapproved' for public use, like strong cryptosystems
not trivially broken by the Govt, or without ed keys
which one cannot readily change (read: use  only permitted by
folks with 'special' connections, or government agencies) as either
'terrorist tools' or 'drug dealers tools'.  Not outlawed SPECIFICALLY
but by added Civil Forfeiture powers, and clever wording, EFFECTIVELY
outlawed for all intents and purposes.

Now, for some idle speculation ... for  who  care, hit 'n' now.

Crypto  EFFECTIVELY outlawed could be done without SPECIFICALLY
outlawing ANY class of crypto systems.  For example, a crowbar, hammers,
screwdrivers, and such can be regarded as 'burglar tools' pretty much
at the whim of the authorities, based primarily on the individual
possessing them in the car, etc. not  in a trade that makes routine
use of  tools.  In a like manner, one who has no 'legitimate need'
(gov't definition) for strong crypto software or systems, and is caught
using them, might find themselves in possession of 'terrorist tools'.
In other words, if one is not working for a corporation with extremely
sensitive commercial data that warrants (in the Fed's opinion) strong
security, or a government agency, and securing only work-related data,
not personal data, one will most likely be nailed on this if discoverd.
A personal desire for 'privacy' most certainly will not be regarded as
a 'legitimate NEED': 
"Why do you want such strong security, especially from 'legitimate law
enforcement'? An individual with 'legitimate' endeavors  not be so
concerned - government is not in the business of revealing your personal
secrets to the public... so you must be trying to conceal or planning
to conceal some unlawful or criminal activity...  DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO HIDE, HMMMM?"
I expect that initially  will be some people selected either at
random, or who happen to have been 'troublemakers' for the purposes of
'making an example' for  who  the Feds are not SERIOUS about
this... (mega ':-('s)

One asking about a 'right' to privacy will probably get a response that
 is no constitutional right for privacy spelled out AS SUCH (an
argument used in the abortion debate):  "You do NOT have a right to have
security that 'Legitimate Law Enforcement cannot break'" (as suggested
in the  Press Release).

This, in a nutshell, is what I find so extremely frightening.  Not only
for crypto systems, as in this case, but for the precident it will set,
laying the groundwork for future erosions of privacy ( of both
safe-deposit box keys - 'master' keys or combinations for privately
owned safes, and so on.  WHY NOT?)...

I cannot  of a better way to make an 'end-run' around 
'inconvenient' parts of the US Constitution.  A law cannot be easily
declared unconstitutional, if it  IS NO SPECIFIC LAW.  It 
simply be a minor extension of the RICO statutes or WoD policies. A
simple policy decision, just like so many of the gun regulations are
mainly BATF policy decisions...  The Conversation of the Fed agents
 go something like:

"We are gonna seize your home, your computers, your car, your bank
account, (you  have to undress and give us yer clothes, unless you
have a floppy in yer pocket) because they are all connected with your
acquisition, transport, and use of 'terrorist tools' and/or 'drug dealers
tools' - part of the WoD or against terrorism, ya unnerstand... no
decent American   be against  noble causes...".

"Note we are not accusing YOU of any wrong-doing ... we are only saying
your HOME, COMPUTERS, CAR, BANK ASSETS are connected with wrong-doing
SOMEHOW - they housed, transported, and funded  'terrorist tools'.
Only a civil matter ...  <heh-heh> ... We had this 'tip'...<grin>".

"Theore, the Constitutional Protection on Individual rights do NOT
apply - we are 'arresting' the tainted PROPERTY... not YOU...<evil grin>".

"If you wish to deposit a BOND, hire some attorneys, and go to  to
PROVE the innocence of this property (that they are not 'terrorist tools'
and again to prove they are not also 'drug dealers tools'), go ahead,
we have no problem with that!  'Course, with your bank assets seized,
no car, computer, or home, (probably no job, too) and your
less-than-limitless resources, you might run into some minor practical
difficulties <grin>...".

THAT is what has me going so damned ballistic...  It is EXACTLY how
the logic goes when someone gives a 'tip' that your home has been
used to store DRUGS...  Note no trace of drugs need to be found on
the property... only some bozo who will say 'yup.  I stored stuff in
that dude's house...' (probably to get out of a 10 year sentence for
dealing).  Much more cost effective to let him walk, to bust another
day, and hit the jackpot with YOUR assets...

Ob Disclaimer (of course)...

Ok, note that I am not a lawyer, and can only base  speculations
on what I have read/heard/been told regarding past Civil Forfeiture
cases, and how they are used to augment the budgets of assorted agencies,
or to get 'cooperation' of folks who just want to be left alone, or who
do not wish to be put in a risky situation (especially in areas where
they are denied either meaningful police protection, AND the  to be
able to even pretend to defend themselves, as is quite common back East,
like NJ, MA, NYC, Wa DC, or out West in CA).   people have the
choice of cowering under the government boot, or cowering under threats
of pissed off drug dealing gang-bangers... helpless in either case...
All behind some dude who drops a dime on you for his gain, or behind
the Feds wanting to 'make an example'...  Civil Forfeiture  the 'hook'.

Point is, are  speculations way out of line, or are they all too
typical, and if so, does the extension to crypto and just about anything
that the Feds regard as 'inconvenient' seem reasonable?  And if not
why not (what are our guarantees, besides the government promises)?

NONE?

   The serial number will be in a 64 bit block, with a 34 bit filler.  Doesn't
   take a lot to check to see if that is correct.

Depends on whether the filler is a constant (makes checking easy,
but susceptible to replay), or variable (e.g. timer, counter, random),
which makes replay harder and can also make it easier for the
inquisitors to know if they've missed messages, or gotten them out of
sequence, or other interesting things that sort of person might care about.

It is  easy to conceal super-encryption, at least until the
inquisitors get ahold of the K key, which can take a ,
presumably not in near-real-time.  (Worst-case, in which the  agencies
provide the U key to the local cops,  only gets one side of the
conversation per warrant, unless the same key is used for both directions,
which I suppose the CAPSTONE version of the chip will probably insist on.)

	   A 'multi-line cleartext bridge?"
			 ^^^^^^^^^
	   And just were  you put that bridge?  If it isn't at one of
   the receiptants location, forget encryption at all.  You have blown any
   security you thought you might have had. 

Most of the people using encrypted conference bridges  days are
military (or equivalent, like CIA and other embassy personnel),
so putting bridges on the recipient's location is normal -
it's in a vault on a military base or Ft. Meade, and the
secure phones are in sound-proof rooms with big locks on the doors
because they're talking about Classified Stuff (or Golf with Other Generals.)

That paradigm will change as we start using encrypted phones in our
offices or homes to carry on normal conversations about dinner plans
and stock purchases and meeting schedules and technical info
and the good batch of illegal frop that we got last weekend from Bob;
most people  use sound-proof vaults, and may use bridges in 
PBX or from the local phone company (3-way calls) or Long Distance
or value-added phone company (e.g. Alliance conference bridges).

If Clipjack is mainly used for the radio portion of cellular phones,
the conferencing aspects  change.  But  may be a market niche for
trusted conference-bridge providers, though I suppose the inquisitors
 try to get a blanket wiretap authorization for many bridges,
just in case a Bad Guy might use the service.

I heard somewhere (can't name the source) that TEMPEST does not necessarily
pick-up just CRTs, but it can pick up emissions from almost any chip.  If
that is true, the kind monitor  not make any difference becuase everything
on the screen can be picked-up from the video controller.  Can anybody verify
or ute this?

Sorry, my news reader doesn't seem to know how to copy a  header.
This tracks the thread "why people  need strong crypto....."

The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 expressly forbids *ing* about building
nuclear devices.   I was in grad school, a friend of mine got a 
security clearance to work on the defense for the Progressive magazine.
He found lots of  which were public domain *removed* from the
local engineering library (Madison Wisconsin).  So the lawyers sent him
all over the states to other libraries to show that the information in
the  was already public.  What pissed everyone off was a local
underground paper went and published the  anyway (it had been
precensored by the feds, that's what this was all about) so the judge
declared the case moot.

The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 has never been tested in .  From my
discussions with several people familiar with the case, only 2 other
times has this preemptive clause been used.  In every case the people
simply did what they felt like and s tossed the cases out.

For all intents and purposes, the government *does* have precidence for
declaring things classified *after* it has been published.   I was
working on Star Wars this happened to me: my clearance was in the works
and I developed a method for tracking p beams.  It was good enough
to classify, so I was no longer allowed to work on it.  A friend from
Canada was in the same boat: he developed a method to compute stripping
cross sections, but because the  was classified *he was not allowed
to present his own paper at a conference!*.  He later published it in an
open journal without problems.

When the going gets wierd, the wierd turn pro.  The feds can do whatever
they want whenever they feel like it, and they will make up rules to let
themselves get away with it.   the mass media can't tell the difference
between a joke and the real thing (like "ranch appocolypse" for the Waco
massacre)  count on them to help spread the word about  loss
of freedom.  The government *can* make strong crypto illegal.  SO WHAT?
 the government does not obey any of its own rules, why  we?

OK Steve, here's a sketch of an alternative that I believe addresses
most of the objections to the  scheme.

Notation:
	+	concatenation
	^	exclusive or
	E(M,K)	message M encrypted by key K
	D(M,K)	message M decrypted by key K
	H(M)	hash (digest/signature) of message M

Important Values:
	U0[X]		local chip unit key from  agency X
	U1[X]		remote chip unit key from  agency X
	N[0]		serial number of the local chip
	N[1]		serial number of the remote chip
	A		number of  agencies
	K[0],K[1]	"session keys" agreed upon external to this protocol
	F		"family key", need not be secret

Protocol:
	Choose K0[1],...K0[A] such that K[0] = K0[1]^...^K0[A]
	Remote chip does same for K[1],K1[1],...,K1[A].

	Compute the following:

		L0[1] = E(K0[1], U0[1])
		...
		L0[A] = E(K0[A], U0[A])

		L[0] = N[0] + E(N[0] + L0[1] + ... + L0[A], F)

		Remote chip does the same for L1[1],...,L1[A],L[1]

	Send L[0] to remote chip and receive L[1] from remote chip

	Compute:

		KE[0] = H(K[0] + N[0] + L0[1] + ... + L0[A]
			+ K[1] + D(L[1], F)

		KD[0] = H(K[1] + D(L[1], F)
			+ K[0] + N[0] + L0[1] + ... + L0[A]

		Note that D(L[1], F) = N[1] + L1[1] + ... + L1[A]

		Remote chip does the same for KE[1] and KD[1]

	User data is encrypted (decrypted) with keys KE[0], KE[1]
		(KD[0], KD[1])

Assumptions:
	No trap doors in E(), D() and H(). H() is not invertible.

	Algorithms for E(), D() and H() are secret. Otherwise a software
	implementation (bogus chip) could communicate with a real chip.

	The chip only supports the following operation:

		1)  Return N[0]
		2)  Load K0[x]
		3)  Return E(K0[x], U0[x])
		4)  Return E(N[0] + L0[1] + ... + L0[A], F)
		5)  Given E(N[1] + L1[1] + ... + L1[A], F),
			return N[1],L1[1],...,L1[A]
		6)  Load K[1]
		7)  Given E(N[1] + L1[1] + ... + L1[A], F),
			compute KE[0], KD[0]
		8)  Given M, return E(M, KE[0])
		9)  Given M, return D(M, KD[0])

	Anything programmed into the chip can be determined by destroying
	the chip (U[1],...,U[A],F,N[0]).

	U[1],...,U[A] can not be determined except by destroying the chip.
	(Unfortunately this may not be true in reality. I suppose it's
	possible to determine how a chip has been programmed with a
	sophisticated[sp?] x-ray machine to look for blown fuses.)

	The U's are programmed independantly by the  agencies.

Notes:
	For tapping  agency Y is given N[0], E(K0[Y], U0[Y]), N[1],
	E(K1[Y], U1[Y]) and returns K0[Y], K1[Y].

	LEA's must contact all  agencies with the serial numbers from
	both chips and the encrypted partial keys. This allows the agencies
	to record that both chips were tapped.

	LEA's only get the session key, not the key to all conversations
	of a particular chip. This precludes real-time decrypting of a
	conversation but that isn't one of the STATED requirements.

Observation:
	In  for any secure by "tap-able" communication scheme to work,
	the active parts need to share a secret. And if this secret is
	revealed, communications by  that know the secret can be made
	"un-tap-able". Obvious candidates are the cryptographic algorithm
	and the master (family) key. Relative size and complexity suggests
	that the key can be obtained from a silicon implementation of the
	scheme a LOT easier and faster than the algorithm.

Why not?  It hasn't been released, so 's no way for you to evaluate it 
yet.  After all, Apple could have been smart and had AOCE use an MD5 hash 
encrypted with RSA, just like PKCS signatures.  They could even be actually 
PKCS compliant, for all you know; why not wait until it is released, and hard 
information is available, before passing judgement on it?

AOCE's algorithm's aren't secret because Apple's  fascistic--AOCE itself 
remains secret (except for Apple demos at MacWorld :)), simply because it's 
not done yet.

It may be flawed, and it may not.  However, you can't tell which until you 
actually see it.  I, at least, am quite impressed with what I have seen so 
far, and have no expectation of  disappointed.

Yes, but the extra encryption could be applied *before* the message
is encrypted by the , so that the wrapper  be fine, the
phone's serial number and the session key  be in the law-enforcement
field, etc., but the message n't be readable even if the particular
's key were obtained from the  agents.  In fact, it n't
even be possible to detect that a message has been double-encrypted without
a  , right?

I was under the impression (from reading Denning's description of the
's operation) that the same session key *is* used in both directions for
encrypting the message text, but that each chip uses it's own key for
encrypting the session key into the law-enforcement field.  So, you only
need to know the U key for one of the phones involved to decrypt the
messages in both directions.

I have, my thesis was on Sun Tzu.

More to the point:

 who are called the good militarists of old, could make opponents
lost contact between front and back , lose reliability between
large and small groups, lose mutual concern for the welfare of the
different social classes among them, lose mutual accomodation between
the rulers and the ruled, lose enlistments among the soldiers, lose
coherence within the armies.  They went into action when it was
advantageous, stopped when it was not.

Today it is.  Sitting on your hands will get you nowhere in this battle.

Is this "White House e-mail address"  working yet? Someone
posted such an address on CompuServe a few months ago, but apparently
the White House wasn't  set up to recive hundreds (thousands?)
of messages a day to that account and didn't want people to use it
yet. So is this MCI address something the people at the White House
actually read, or is it another Craig Shergold story? I  know --
I'm just asking.

Unless the people at the White House print and distribute this mail
every day, you may have better luck printing out a letter (on paper,
that flat white stuff all over my desk) and Snail-Mailing it to the
White House. I imagine writing to your local representative and
senator n't hurt either. Heck, why not write to Al Gore 
you're at it?

I  believe you, and I  believe your friend.

Why? 

Because DES is not known to have any known plaintext attacks readily
availble. Unless your friend knows something and is keeping it secret,
he was bullshitting you.

Now, it IS possible that he noted a weakness in the *implementation* of
the Kerberos protocol. For instance, using a weak RNG to generate keys
might cut down on the keyspace (not for the user keys -- for the other
kind who's name I can't remember). However, this is not what was
claimed. You are claiming a general weakness in DES, which is not
known to exist in the open literature.

 get me wrong -- DES is weaker than it  be. However,
cracking it in 15 minutes requires more money be spent on the cracking
machine than ANY  I know of has available.

	This is a real address. My understanding of the current process
that mail takes is it gets downloaded on floppy disk and is processed
by retiree volunteers, who match the message against message profiles
and check the message count. (I.e.: "yeah, that's a for gays in the
military. what's this  stuff? must be against gays in the
military...")

	The higher-volume white-house email stuff is in the works,
I know for a fact, but won't be online for probably another month
or two at the soonest. My understanding is that the link speed will
increase (direct internet instead of Compu$erve to floppy) but the
message processing will remain the same.

	The white house email does get read. I agree that printing it
and sending Cc: to everyone you can  of is probably better because
it is more visible, but the message processing (fitting messages against
a template) is the same in either case.

   transmit encrypted data from the U.S. to another country?  If so,
   then which laws apply to this situation?

From the US law perspective, unless you're engaging in illegal speech,
it's not illegal to use encryption.  Yet.  The NSA is allowed to try
to listen, but you're not obligated to make it easy for them.  Yet.
The other country may have more repressive laws about that;
I gather France's bureaucracy wants to know what you're saying, 
and in the old Soviet Union, they didn't need laws to make things illegal :-(

(paranoia follows, for  of you who want to play it safe :-)
The fact that the NSA is listening may affect your willingness to use
wimpy crypto technologies, but it may also affect your willingness to
use technologies that violate RSA's patents, e.g. if you use PGP, the
NSA may tell RSA that you're doing so, and if the Secret Service catches on,
they may decide that the mere fact that RSA hasn't filed a lawsuit
against you doesn't mean that you  deserve to have your computer
confiscated for possible patent violation, munitions law violation,
espionage, money laundering, drug importation, and creatin' a disturbance,
and then not give it back because you *did* violate the patent even
though they had to drop all the other charges, unlike that nasty Steve
Jackson who had the gall not to be guilty of *anything*.

   I heard somewhere (can't name the source) that TEMPEST does not necessarily
   pick-up just CRTs, but it can pick up emissions from almost any chip.  If
   that is true, the kind monitor  not make any difference becuase everything
   on the screen can be picked-up from the video controller.  Can anybody verify
   or ute this?

Yes, that's true.  TEMPEST is nothing magic, it's just listening to any
available electromagnetic emissions and using all the analysis techniques  
you know to separate out the interesting stuff. 

The nice thing about old CRTs is that they used to put out LOTS of
signal, so they're easy to detect, and if you do your sync caully,
you can watch the output on the monitor in your deceptively-marked
Chevy Step-Van.  Some brands of electric typewriters were even worse.
In both cases, it's especially nice because it gets you the data the
user is looking at, rather than whatever stuff the paging algorithm is
paging out to disk, etc.

With newer, quieter equipment,  isn't as much signal, and it's harder to
isolate the fun parts.  TEMPEST-rated equipment has much lower signal levels.
But "Everything has vibrations", as Master Chuan said.

Just thought of something.  Yes, laptops can  be read, but it's not quite
as easy as a normal pc with a CRT.  My thought, Airline pilots lately have
been complaining about how laptops  used in flight mess with the plane's
instruments.  If this can be hyped up, manufacturers may start building
laptops with even lower emmisions.  It  probably  be possible to
pick up with surveillance equipment, but at this point, it  be a lot
cheaper to mask the remaining signals with TEMPEST techniques.

   You  probably use numbers much larger than 64-bits.  Also, you
may want to include some randomly-generated bitstrings in your protocol.
This way, if someone  find the shared key you and another person
use on one day, they won't be able to guess it for the next day....
 
   Ie A sends G**A mod P and random string R0
      B sends G**B mod P and random string R1
 
      Both find (G**A mod P)** B mod P = Shared Key, then both calculate
 
      Session Key = Hash(R0,Shared Key, R1)
 
   Also, you will want to make sure that you're getting the right public
key value G**A mod P.  Someone with the power to intercept and change messages
can oterwise spoof you by sending both of you *his* public key, and then
acquiring a session key with each of you....

Gentlefolk,

        It seems to me that the "Step 1" of taking a warrant to the
        telco to get a wiretap is so much stinky red herring (
        you love animal metaphors).

        With each phone broadcasting the serial number of its chip
        ("E(N;F)" is not syntactically different than "N"), all they
        have to do is aim a reciever in the general direction of
        today's target and use the serial number to identify the
        session they want, and get the chip number of the other end of
        the conversation. Even without the key, this is great for
        traffic analysis. I can  of several ways to learn the
        right serial number.

        It looks like one intended effect of the  is to
        eliminate the awkward business of getting the telco to
        cooperate (or risking getting caught in the act with your
        alligator clips erect). This is particularly handy if you have
        S1 and S2.

        BTW, did anyone explain why they are scrambling the serial
        number?
        
        Cheers,
                Marc

        Only guessing, but from his address I'd say that Jerry, like
        me, lives in Canada. Unlike me, he s that our friends in
        the US enjoy the same freedom that we do, and he has not seen
        the slow but steady erosion to the south of us.

        We have the benefit of relatively slow politicians and
        ineffective law enforcement. Our rednecks tend to be the
        objects of derision rather than elected officials. It's
        everything LE can do to keep up with the real criminals. Any
        time they actually go after somebody just because they 
        like his or her attitude, it's national news (It also often
        blows up in  faces: eg. the well-intentioned but flawed
        Zundel case, which resulted in a scolding from the Supreme
        , not only to LE for prosecuting the case but to
        Parliament for passing the law it was prosecuted under).

        Our friends south of the b  have as easy a time of
        it. Among other things they have as many LE agencies as we
        have agencies, and some of them have teeth. They also have the
        War on Drugs which gives law-enforcement agencies exceptional
        powers to ignore individuals' rights (the DEA has more
        arbitrary power than that given to Canadian agencies under the
        War Measures Act). We have the RCMP and CSIS who can't stop
        fighting each other long enough to do any  effective
        suppression of private citizens' rights. Not only that, our
        Police Commissions have teeth, as I learned when I had to fend
        off a bent cop.

        It may be ironic that the nation founded on Life, Liberty and
        the Pursuit of Happiness is getting government-imposed ,
         the nation founded on Peace,  and Good Government
        is getting in-your-face liberty.

        That's not to say our time won't come. It looks like Chretien
        is going to run on a law-and- platform. Be afraid.

        Cheers,

        Looking at it from up here in the Frozen North, it looks like
        you could do worse than get the NRA involved. They have a
        kindred problem, a large number of voters, the right attitude,
        and lots of funds.

        From an ethical _or_ constitutional viewpoint, I haven't seen
        a good argument for cryptographic rights that doesn't also
        support the NRA position on guns (and vice-versa).

But the NSA will not be doing any wiretapping.  The actual wiretapping will,
presumably, be conducted by the FBI.  Of course, the capability for this was
provided by the NSA, but I  that they are  within the limitations
of  charter.

I realize this is a fine point, and some may differ, but this is my opinion.
Although I  care for  and won't support or use it, I  see
the NSA as having overstepped  bounds.

It also goes like this:

FED2: Who do we have a tap on?

FED1: <some other enemy of the state>.

FED2: So get the keys - we can always claim that phone's  used on the
      tapped line.

's got to be some way to associate an instrument with an individual or
the state effectively has a tap, possibly not admissible (given the War on

listenable tap on any phone.

Hmmm.... CELP takes up about 12.6 MIPS for full duplex, and has been
implemented on about a million DSP chips... the 56001 card in my PC only cost
about $700, and I'm sure once demand goes up the prices  drop. The Analog
Devices 21020 board that we're looking at now cost about $500 (academic price).
I   hardware is something to worry about... if you get it working,
people will snap up internet phone cards like  was no tomorrow.
What we need here is a good implementation of CELP (the government code is
absolute crap, I got a 30% speedup after looking at it for a couple of hours),
and modifications to pgp to allow it to compress/decompress 144 bit frames
every 30msec... I  the AD21020  have enough juice for this (50MIPS).
As part of the project I'm working on now, we're trying to get CELP up and
running in realtime full duplex mode... I gotta find the source to pgp and
see how tough it  be to integrate the en/decryption parts into the code.
I'll play with it. Anyone else out  got an AD21020 setup?

As anyone who attended HoHoCon will attest, you can pick information
off the video chip.  It's surprisingly easy too.  The guy did it with
a portable TV, with very minor mods.  It only worked from 3 feet, but
then it was just a demonstration.

  In  to have formulate a rational position on what cryptography
policies are acceptable, we must set forth a list of basic requirements.
I  propose the following as a starting point:

  1. The algorithm must be publicly known, and must have a record of
       surviving attempts by outside experts to find weaknesses.

  2. The system implementation must make it possible to verify that the
       advertised algorithm is, in fact, the one that is  used.

  3. The key must be quickly changeable by the user, and must be of a
       sufficient length and complexity to defeat any brute-force search
       possible now or in the reasonably near future.

  Note that  requirements are not incompatible with some form of key
 system; the May 1993 issue of "Byte" describes an example of an
encryption system which can clearly be implemented in a manner consistent
with the above requirements  requiring that parts of the key be
ed in  to have one's public key listed by a central distributor.

You can find what you're looking for on hundreds of sites worldwide.  Try

	anonymous ftp to nic.funet.fi (Finland)

	/pub/unix/4.3bsd/net2/lib/libc/gen/crypt.c.Z

This includes source code for fully-functional DES encryption and decryption.

 are some who believe that public domain code is exportable, some
who .  Make your own judgements, but it seems obvious to me.

I'm afraid I have to disagree with you on that point.  NSA will *not*
tell RSA or any other non-DOD entity anything that its eavesdropping
reveals.  That includes the FBI and Secrect Service (although 
have been rare exceptions).

Well, regardless of what policy liabilities anyone in Washington may 
EFF has, it is going ahead aggressively attacking the assumptions that are
behind the Administrations  Chip initiative.  For all the reasons
stated here.  In Washington, you have to work under the assumption that 
everyone has some liabilities.  Government and non-governmental 
s alike all share the same glass house.  EFF is variously
identified as the Hacker Defense Fund, the First Amendment Absolutists,
the New Communists, etc, but it is also an acknowledged leader in the
civil liberties arena and is respected as a serious player in the 
policy circles.  So unless  is another  with the
credibility and clout and right policy stance that you know of in
Washington, please  count EFF out as a valid representative of
your views in the  Chip matter.

        This one is easy, they 'tape' the conversation, call the FBI or
Secret Service.  You see "activities against the Satan Clinton" could be
construed as a threat against the President of the United States.  I am

This is rather simple, actually ...

Having just been through a revolution, our founding fathers  well
understood  the  relationship between We the People and a govern-
ment of, by and for the people. They  also  understood  that  any
government  of  the People can sometimes grow to become a govern-
ment not "by" the People or not "for" the  People.  This  is  how
they chose to handle all of the possibilities:

   2nd Amendment
   A well-regulated militia  necessary to the security of a
   free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall
   not be infringed.

This is the ONLY part of the  Constitution  which  gives  us  the
right  of  revolution  if  things  seem to be going cockeyed. All
that's  necessary is an organized march on Washington, just
have everyone bring  arms. Obviously the 2nd is an important
right, a right which many Americans do not fully appreciate.

Hope this helps,

Ray.

 are several things in ITAR which have never been tested in . 
The concensus appears to be:

You could be arrested as an international arms trafficker.  (You could,
regardless of the state of the law, but  are some paragraphs which
suggest you  be violating the law.)

If it goes to , the ITARs could be thrown out is incompatible with the
First amendment; or the  could rule that "software" is "technical
data" not  to the ITARs; or the  could rule that the
phrase "publicly available" as defined in the ITARs  apply,
making it only  to requiring a general export license; or, you could
be prosecuted successfully for arms trafficing or espionage.  General
concensus among lawyers who have read the ITARs, is that one of the first
two  occur.

I'd use a secret (nope, obscure) cryptographic encoding to expand the 
30 bit serial number to a 64 bit block. The redundancy hereby introduced 
can be used to detect tampered  signals where some public enemy 
replaced the L.E. block by random data. 

And of course the L.E. block  be used to initialise the encryption 
of the user data so that at the receiving end the correct L.E. block must 
be processed in  to have any chance of getting the plaintext back. 

For  of you who might want to mangle the L.E. block (e.g. by xor-ing 
a constant pattern) on the transmission line and restore it before feeding 
it into the receiving Crippler Chip I  add further encrypted copies 
of this block (perhaps created by repeated application of the encryption 
algorithm or so) at regular intervals during the transmission. If the 
receiving chip detects a mismatch it must assume that the line is bad and 
it will cease to work; in your own interest you are protected from getting 
faulty plaintext, you know -- it's just like a checksum for your own 
safety ;-(. 

The `monitoring agencies' won't have the famous black box which is needed 
for actual decryption and will be kept by the FBI; but nothing prevents 
them from using special boxes which will do the redundancy check for the 
serial number block and consistency checks on the embedded L.E. blocks 
within the transmission.  boxes will turn a red light on as soon as 
they detect a bitstream that violates the correct protocol.

So  anyone  that you can use the chip and fool L.E. about the 
tapping key -- I bet the developpers have provided much better checks 
than  suggested above. Of course it's absolutely crucial that the 
algorithms (and protocols) remain secret. Personally I doubt they will.

Hi,

I'd like to thank you all for the fast responses. 
Special thanks go to  who replied (lexical ):

wcs@anchor.ho.att.com (Bill Stewart) 

My question was:

>how sensible is DES encrypted data towards bit errors? How much data per
>bit will be lost in average (I assume you  have the correct key)?

How much of the DES-encrypted data is affected depends on the used
encryption mode. According to Marcus J Ranum (mjr@TIS.COM)  is:

|	cfb = cipher feedback mode
|	ecb = electronic code book mode
|	cbc = cipher block chaining mode
|	ofb = output feedback mode
|
|	each mode does some stuff better than others. ofb and cfb are designed
|for communications streams more than for files.

Unfortunally, people strongly disagree which mode will lead to destruction
of all of the following data. Sure seems that some modes will resync quite
fast, others will never, others will even only effect the very block.

Summarized, people said concerning *this* matter:

/
|In CBC mode, only the current block will be affected (tarnold@vnet.IBM.COM 
|<Todd W. Arnold>).
|
|If you use CBC (Cihper Block Chaining), then the remainder of the data
|will be destroyed as well. (pausch@saaf.se <Paul Schlyter>)
|
|In CFB mode, DES synchronizes quite fast (probably within 1 block 
|according to Maracus J Ranum <mjr@TIS.COM>).
\

Maybe someone *definitely* knows what happens in which mode?

Nevertheless, Thank you all very much again.

It depends on the mode you're using.  For a single 64-bit input block, a
one-bit error will have a 50 percent chance of corrupting each of the 64
output bits - in other words, it essentially turns the output block into
a random number.  If you're encrypting data in CBC mode, however, only the
one 64-bit block will be affected.  The next block, and all that follow it
will be decrypted properly.

It's a good idea to have some kind of error correction in your system if
corrupted bits are likely.

At least 8 bytes of data will be destroyed if one bit encrypted data is
in error.

If you use CBC (Cihper Block Chaining), then the remainder of the data
will be destroyed as well.

DES is VERY seisitive for single bit errors.  This is as it  be.

Probably very bad; you might lose the rest of the data stream.  If you
want safety against dropped bits use an error correcting coder like the
freeware GNU ecc.

   how sensible is DES encrypted data towards bit errors? How much data per
   bit will be lost in average (I assume you  have the correct key)?

It depends on the mode you're using DES in.
Electronic Code Book (ECB) takes a block of 64 input bits
and produces 64 output bits, so if any bits are changed,
the entire block of 64 bits becomes bad.
I forget which feedback mode is which.
In all of them, the results of encrypting one block affect later blocks.
With some modes, the system self-synchronizes, so errors are repaired
in a few blocks.  With other modes, once one block is bad,
all later blocks will be bad too.

's also the framing problem.  If you have a bit change,
the block that it's in changes, and maybe later blocks also change.
But if you have bits lost or bits added (64 bits in, 63 or 65 bits out),
everything is confused after that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Marcus J Ranum <mjr@TIS.COM>

	depends on the mode you're using. cfb, for example, synchronises
pretty fast. figure a bit error will destroy the current block and the
next one.

Big deal. If you are a legitimate law enforcement agent and have a
legitimate wiretap , you just listen in on the line for 10
minutes, get the serial number, and then take the  and go to the
 agencies. If you notice the criminal is now using a different
phone instrument, take your -valid wiretap  to the 
agency with the new serial number. (This provides opportunities for
abuse by law enforcement, but thats not what we are discussing right
now.) I oppose , but the mechanics here are simple and easy to
understand. The whole rest of your  is based on a large series
of false premises, all predicated on the notion that this simple act
is somehow impossible.

I feel free to presume to tell you that you do not seem to understand
the mechanics of the proposal. Arguing that terrorists will be killing
people for   phones is silly because its pointless. Lets
be alarmist about what   show up as a problem, shall we?

One thing that seems ambiguous is whether a signal  echoed down from
geosynchronous orbit is "...from outside the United States."

Also,  able to assess whether NSA is playing by the rules requires
knowing what the rules are. We only know a subset. For  even more
suspicious,  could be other surveillance s "blacker"
than the NSA.

The *security* of the system does depend only on the secrecy of the keys.

The ability to tap is an inherent *insecurity* which depends fundamentally on
the secrecy of the algorithm.  To spell it out, because so many people seem to
miss the point, if the algorithm were published, anyone could create a chip
which  work correctly with the Skipjack chips but which  not have
its key registered.

I believe  is no technical  of ensuring key  without the
government maintaining a secret of some kind.  For example, the secret could be
the private keys of the  agencies;  digital signatures  be
required before a key could be used.  In this case, the NSA/NIST/whoever has
decided that protecting the entire algorithm is easier/cheaper/more secure than
other possible protocols.

Thanks. Got that from two other sources as well. The full quote is as
follows:

From Dorothy Denning, CRYPTOGRAPHY AND DATA SECURITY, Addison-Wesley
1982,1983, page 8:

"Cryptosystems must satisfy three general requirements:

"1. The enciphering and deciphering transformations must be efficient for
all keys.

"2. The system must be easy to use.

"3. The security of the system  depend only on the secrecy of the
keys and not on the secrecy of algorithms E [enciphering] or D
[deciphering]."

Congress isn't forced to do ANYTHING.  Not even follow  own rules,

It will be like the old saw in New Jersey and New York, Chicago, etc
when the politicians PROMISED that this spiffy new gun registration law
will NOT be used for future confiscation purposes.  Sure enough, a few
years later, when they WERE used JUST FOR THAT PURPOSE, and folks
complained, the response was "Well, *I* didn't make that promise..."
Some politicians may not even wait a few years...  ed keys 
have the same assurances of security.  Besides, if someone wants to
snoop, how are YOU to know - you   they will send you a letter
saying "We are now snooping on your private conversations...", do you?
What are the assurances the  people will not be FORBIDDEN to
report any access attempts for one's keys?

So much for government assurances of privacy.

n't the Second Amendment also come into play here?

In some hobby shop, they sell a flexible tube (1/4-inch diameter,
18-inch ling) that will illuminate if you bend or shake it (it
is also sold in amusement parks in the evenings). The brightness
can last 2 to 4 hours. If it is left in rigrator (in coldness),
you can prolong its life of illumination.

Is this something we can make ourself easily? Or, do you know any
reading can provide details about this stuff? Working with kids,
it  be nice if it can be a do-it-yourself project with 
minimum budget.

May I suggest that any any proposed cipher system
having less entropy than the user's key and message can have
an embedded subliminal channel as big as the
difference in entropies between the entropy of the user
input (message) and the entropy of the output?

For example, take plain DES.  The unsuspecting
user inputs a string "PLAINTEXT" to be enciphered.

He cranks the algorithm which has been hacked
by George Quisling and comes out with j*3H4902d.

Nine char in and nine chars out.  Right?

The unsepecting user ships the ciphertext
to be decrpyted and the message "PLAINTEXT"
is produced.  Everything fine, right?  Nope.


Imagine the algorithm did a LZ compression
on PLAINTEXT before DESing. (Compressing is
down to four characters with more entropy:

9#wj

The opponent now pads the message with his
own message, also compressed

*3dk@

before applying DES to the concatenated
compressed pairs.  When decrpyted, the
first compressed message is stripped off
and declared sent.  Unbeknowst to the
receiver, the opponents accomplice collects
the remaining message in the bit bucket and
uncompresses to KILL NOW.

And to prevent all such subliminal or covert
storage channels you  need to have 
maximal entropy all the time -- which is
a priori impossible because (for example)
a stereotypical message might be
replaced by one bit in the output reserving
the rest of the output bits for the long
covert message.

In other words, if you opponent get to muck
with the algorithm -- you either have got to
muck with it LAST or concede his possible 
embedding of covert channels.

In other words, if you present a message
to an opponet with less than maximal entropy
then you have given him free bits of storage.

> We  know this, do we?  The algorithm is classified. 

I speculate, from the MykoTronx data sheet on the MYK-78, that the algorithm 
is a classified cryptosystem, similar in application to DES but cleared by 
the NSA for classified traffic, that has been in use for a number of years.  
Myktotronx ers to it as "Government Type II encryption", which matches the 
designation of one of the types of encryption available on STU-III phones, 
and may be the same as a cryptosystem I have heard called "CIPHER2".

This  make sense,  this is evidently a field-proven cryptosystem 
which can act as a "pin-compatible" substitute for DES.  Combined with a 
tappable key exchange protocol, this  offer exactly what is claimed for 
: secure encryption with access via a key .  If this is fact the 
case, it  make me quite confident of the encipherment algorithm itself.

Now, I do not know if  are in fact the same cryptosystem; my knowledge 
of classified cryptography isn't even fuzzy :), it's nonexistent.  However, 
it  certainly have been the least-effort approach on the part of the 
government: take an old military cipher that people can drop in place of DES 
(and which is at least as secure), set up a key  scheme for law 
enforcement, and promote it for public use.  This also fits with Mykotronx, 
who's been around but almost invisible for years.

Has anyone else made this sort of connection, or am I just hallucinating pink 
elephants here? :).  My curiousity has been piqued...

Hmmm... I n't consider encryption to be a weapon.  How  the
government classify encryption?  Seems to me that encryption ought to
be covered by the first amendment.   Using this line of reasoning, the
government n't be able to restrict what data people encrypt and
what encryption algorithms they use because this  be restricting
one's freedom of speech.  In other words, encrypted data---text,
graphics, or other information---is just another form of free speech.
For this reason the government n't be able to regulate the use
of encryption algorithms and encrypted data.  The only time the
government  be able to 'force' someone to reveal his or her
encryption keys for some encrypted data is when the encrypted data
in question may be something that isn't protected by the first
amendment such as kiddy porn.  Even in a case like this the
government  be required to get a search warrant before coercing
someone into revealing the keys.

BTW, what encryption methods are considered to be state-of-the-art
nowdays.  Have the feds relaxed export restrictions on DES yet?
Also, is DES  regarded as a good form of encryption?

I have been looking over the postings about the  Chip and noticed
an interesting omission from the discussion.

You all mention that the algorithm is classified and have expressed 
concerns and ideas of how to figure out the algorithm using software.

The question that I have is why cant someone take one of  chips
and reverse engineer it? I mean, take the thing to a chip testing/
analysis facility, one with a decent electron microscope. Just pry
off the top of the chip and start scanning it with the electron
microcope and figure out the circuitry. I remembered a place that I use
to work for had one of  facilities that they used to analyze chips
that we accidently blew out  running tests. They could actually find
the area that was fried and show us where in the circuit it was. 

I am sure that many companies and universities must have  facilities
and that the potential is , especially at a  where the
security at such a facility is looser, for someone to take a 
apart and analyze it?

What can the government do to prevent this? Start taking away all 
microchip analysis facilities and electron microscopes??

Dear Senator/Congressman/President {fill in the blank}

I am writing you to voice my strong opposition to President Clinton's  
Chip initiative. This proposal to establish a secret government designed
cryptography chip with government key registration as the standard for voice
encryption is very disturbing. The idea that citizens must register  
secrets with the government just in case they are trying to keep them secret 
is patently unAmerican. Additionally, the press release for this program
strongly implied that other forms of cryptography  be banned after the 
 Chip standard is in place. This latest attack on our civil rights is 
deeply disturbing and is frankly a voting issue for me. 

The presidents press release stated that the plan strikes a balance between the
legitimate needs of law enforcement and a citizens right to privacy but this 
is not the case. The fact is that  other strong cryptographic equipment 
is avalible the criminals, drug dealers and terrorists mentioned in the press 
release will simply use non  cryptography. Mean the average citizen
may gain no protection against warentless wiretaps by the government  the 
government ed key is derived deterministicly from the unit serial number
which is broadcast by the chip durring its opperation. This seems like an 
obvious back door for the NSA and law enforcement. If you  do nott 
understand my objection to key registration, consider the way J. Edgar Hoover 
blackmailed government officials like yourself;  you now use a phone to 
transmit personal details of your life that the NSA and FBI have the keys to?

Because much of the public aren't even aware of the NAMES of informative
publications.  Look at the 'wealth' of material on the typical newsstand.
Unless the person is working in some kind of technical environment, with
the usual trade journals, all they ever see is the media (note: media
in this context is the popular media - TV, radio, daily newspapers, and
such publications as Time, Newsweek, and all that).  And they all say
pretty much the same thing.  I see most of them  in the range of
center-left to far Left, and generally supportive of pie-in-sky
we-will-take- care-of-you--for-you-cradle-to-grave.   seems
to be an air of arrogance that the individual is not capable of
understanding major issues so the media doesn't bother to inform them
(as with , for example) or tells the people how to interpret
events in others.  What is lost sight of is that the people are not good
at understanding things because they are not TOLD accurate information
about them.  It is a lot to expect of the people for them to be
clarirvoyant.  For example, I  have been unaware of  had
I not picked it up on USENET.  How much of the population has USENET,
let alone Internet access?

For access to better publications, the person has to spend time digging.
Many folks, especially who work long hours, have families, etc., do not
have TIME to go digging, and many are not (yet) aware things are wrong,
so are not motivated to dig.  Not saying its right, just saying that is
the way things are.  People aren't upset about things when they aren't
TOLD.  And the less than objective media is a major contributer to the
problem.

And then compound that with an attitude of arrogance in the civil service
(bureaucrats, politicians) that act as if the person without political
connections, or deep pockets (potential contributer)  have few if
any rights,  a resource to be used by  in control for 
polticial or financial gain.  Some Law Enforcement agencies act as if
they regard the common person with a rather intense degree of contempt,
peons that are supposed to do what they are TOLD, and get very nasty
when someone questions them.  The media pundits/editors, etc tend to
fall into  with privilege, and tend to not be upset by the current
state of affairs.  The fellow in DC, who shot the swimmer in his Jacuzzi
for daring to swim in it, with an ILLEGALLY owned gun (violating the law
he pushed to be foisted on everyone else), ends up walking where a less
well-connected person  have been crucified.  A typical example of
one standard for 'us', a much more restrictive standard for 'other folk'.

Perhaps I am not real eloquent in expressing this, but the solution
sure as hell is NOT to make it HARDER for people to find out what is
going on, or dismiss  concerns because one happens to be in a position
where one feels they are exempt or insulated.  Such as that hypocrite of
a journalist in DC described above.  One notices that  less-than
complimentary points about that double-standard was NOT covered in the
media.  I feel the reason was it dovetailed with  political views
on the , and it involved a 'brother' journalist.

Isn't it time for our 'objective' media, the MAIN SOURCE of info for the
average person, to start  what they claim to be, instead of spin
doctors for the Statist elements?

Are you in contact with her, is that what she said, or what you 
her reason is?

Also, could it be possible that she is not replying because she has
no reply that n't confirm the worst suspicions?  If the suspicions
are way out of pocket, one   the person  be in 
saying so, and indicating WHY they are out of pocket.  Hiding behind
a veil of secrecy is not reassuring.

  FROM CROSSBOWS TO CRYPTOGRAPHY:  THWARTING THE STATE VIA
                     TECHNOLOGY

  Given at the Future of Freedom Conference, November 1987


     You   know,   technology--and   particularly   computer
technology--has often gotten a bad rap in  Libertarian  cir-
cles.  We tend to  of Orwell's 1984, or Terry Gilliam's
Brazil,  or  the  proximity  detectors keeping East Berlin's
slave/citizens on  own side of the b, or  the  so-
phisticated  bugging  devices  Nixon used to harass  on
his "enemies list."  Or, we recognize that for the price  of
a  ticket  on  the Concorde we can fly at twice the speed of
sound, but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run  by
a  government  policeman, and permit him to paw thru our be-
longings if it beeps.

     But I  that mind-set is a mistake.   Before  
were cattle prods, governments tortured  prisoners with
clubs  and  rubber  hoses.    Before    were lasers for
eavesdropping, governments used binoculars and  lip-readers.
Though  government certainly uses technology to oppress, the
evil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools.

     In fact, technology represents one of the most  promis-
ing  avenues  available  for  re-capturing our freedoms from
 who have stolen them.  By its very nature,  it  favors
the  bright  (who can put it to use) over the dull (who can-
not).  It favors the adaptable (who are  quick  to  see  the
merit  of  the  new  (over  the sluggish (who cling to time-
tested ways).  And what two better words are    to  de-
scribe government bureaucracy than "dull" and "sluggish"?

     One  of  the  clearest,  classic triumphs of technology
over tyranny I see is  the  invention  of  the  man-portable
crossbow.   With it, an untrained peasant could now reliably
and lethally engage a target out to  fifty  meters--even  if
that  target  were  a mounted, chain-mailed knight.  (Unlike
the longbow, which, admittedly was more powerful, and  could
get  off  more shots per unit time, the crossbow required no
formal training to utilize.   Whereas the  longbow  required
elaborate  visual,  tactile  and kinesthetic coordination to
achieve any degree of accuracy, the wielder  of  a  crossbow
could simply put the weapon to his er, sight along the
arrow  itself, and be reasonably assured of hitting his tar-
get.)

     Moreover,  just about  the  only  mounted  knights
likely  to  visit  your  average peasant  be government
soldiers and tax collectors, the utility of the  device  was
plain:    With it, the common rabble could defend themselves
not only against one another, but against  governmental
masters.   It was the  medieval  equivalent  of  the  armor-
piercing  bullet,  and, consequently, kings and priests (the
medieval equivalent of a  Bureau  of  Alcohol,  Tobacco  and
Crossbows)  threatened  death  and  excommunication, respec-
tively, for its unlawful possession.

     Looking at later developments, we  see  how  technology
like  the  firearm--particularly the repeating rifle and the
handgun, later followed by the Gatling gun and more advanced
machine guns--radically altered the balance of interpersonal
and inter-group power.  Not without reason was the Colt  .45
called "the equalizer."  A frail dance-hall hostess with one
in  her  possession  was  now  fully able to protect herself
against the brawniest roughneck in any saloon.    Advertise-
ments  for  the period also lect the merchandising of the
repeating cartridge  rifle  by  declaring  that  "a  man  on
horseback,  armed with one of  rifles, simply cannot be
captured."  And, as long as his captors  were  relying  upon
flintlocks  or  single-shot rifles, the quote is doubtless a
true one.

     Updating now to  the  present,  the  public-key  cipher
(with  a  personal  computer to run it) represents an equiv-
alent quantum leap--in a defensive weapon.    Not  only  can
such  a technique be used to protect sensitive data in one's
own possession, but it can also permit two strangers to  ex-
change   information   over   an   insecure   communications
channel--a  wiretapped   phone   line,   for   example,   or
skywriting, for that matter)--without ever having previously
met  to  exchange cipher keys.   With a thousand-dollar com-
puter, you can create a cipher that  a  multi-megabuck  CRAY
X-MP  can't  crack in a year.  Within a few years, it 
be economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi-
cations; soon after that, full-color digitized video images.
Technology will not only have made wiretapping obsolete,  it
will  have  totally demolished government's control over in-
formation transfer.

     I'd like to take just a moment to sketch the  mathemat-
ics  which makes this principle possible.  This algorithm is
called the RSA algorithm, after Rivest, Shamir, and  Adleman
who  jointly created it.  Its security derives from the fact
that, if a very large number is  the  product  of  two  very
large  primes,  then it is extremely difficult to obtain the
two prime factors from analysis  of    product.    "Ex-
tremely"  in  the  sense that if primes  p  and  q  have 100
digits apiece, then  200-digit product cannot  in  gen-
eral be factored in less than 100 years by the most powerful
computer now in existence.

     The  "public" part of the key consists of (1) the prod-
uct  pq  of the two large primes p and q, and (2)  one  fac-
tor,  call it  x  , of the product  xy  where  xy = {(p-1) *
(q-1) + 1}.  The "private" part of the key consists  of  the
other factor  y.

     Each  block of the text to be encrypted is first turned
into an integer--either by using ASCII,  or  even  a  simple
A=01,  B=02,  C=03, ... , Z=26 representation.  This integer
is then raised to the power  x (modulo pq) and the resulting
integer is then sent as the encrypted message.  The receiver
decrypts by taking this integer to the  (secret)  power    y
(modulo  pq).  It can be shown that this process will always
yield the original number started with.

     What makes this a groundbreaking development,  and  why
it  is  called  "public-key"  cryptography,"  is  that I can
openly publish the product  pq and the number   x   ,  
keeping  secret  the number  y  --so that anyone can send me
an encrypted message, namely
                       x
                     a    (mod pq)  ,
but only I can recover the original message  a  , by  taking
what  they  send, raising it to the power  y  and taking the
result (mod pq).  The risky step (meeting to exchange cipher
keys) has been eliminated.  So people who may not even trust
each other enough to want to meet, may    reliably  ex-
change  encrypted  messages--each  party having selected and
disseminated his own  pq  and his  x  ,     maintaining
the secrecy of his own  y.

     Another benefit of this scheme is the notion of a "dig-
ital signature," to enable one to authenticate the source of
a given message.  Normally, if I want to send you a message,
I raise my plaintext  a  to your x and take the result  (mod
your pq)  and send that.

    However,  if in my message, I take the plaintext  a and
raise it to my (secret) power  y  , take the result  (mod my
pq), then raise that result to your x   (mod  your  pq)  and
send this, then even after you have normally "decrypted" the
message,  it  will  look like garbage.  However, if you
then raise it to my public power x   , and take  the  result
(mod  my public pq  ), so you will not only recover the ori-
ginal plaintext message, but you will know that no one but I
could have sent it to you ( no one else knows my secret
y).

     And  are the very concerns by the way that are to-
day tormenting the Soviet Union about the whole question  of
personal  computers.    On the one hand, they recognize that
American schoolchildren are right now growing up  with  com-
puters  as commonplace as sliderules used to be--more so, in
fact, because  are things computers can do  which  will
interest  (and instruct) 3- and 4-year-olds.  And it is pre-
cisely  students who one generation hence will be going
head-to-head against  Soviet  counterparts.    For  the
Soviets  to  hold  back might be a suicidal as continuing to
teach swordsmanship    your  adversaries  are  learning
ballistics.    On  the  other hand, whatever else a personal
computer may be, it is also an exquisitely efficient copying
machine--a floppy disk will hold upwards of 50,000 words  of
text,  and  can  be  copied in a couple of minutes.  If this
weren't threatening enough, the computer that  performs  the
copy  can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all but
unbreakable.  Remember that in Soviet society  publicly  ac-
cessible  Xerox  machines are unknown.   (The relatively few
copying machines in existence  are  controlled  more  inten-
sively than machine guns are in the United States.)

     Now  the  "conservative" position is that we  not
sell  computers to the Soviets, because they could  use
them  in weapons systems.  The "liberal" position is that we
 sell them, in  the  interests  of  mutual  trade  and
cooperation--and  anyway,  if  we  make the sale, 
will certainly be some other nation willing to.

     For my part, I'm ready to suggest that the  Libertarian
position  be to give them to the Soviets for free, and
if  necessary, make them take them . . . and if that doesn't
work load up an SR-71  Blackbird  and  air  drop  them  over
Moscow in the middle of the night.  Paid for by private sub-
scription, of course, not taxation . . . I confess that this
is not a position that has gained much support among members
of  the conventional left-right political spectrum, but, af-
ter all, in the words of one of Illuminatus's characters, we
are political non-Euclideans:   The shortest distance  to  a
particular  goal may not look anything like what most people
 consider a "straight line."    Taking  a  long  enough
world-view,  it is arguable that breaking the Soviet govern-
ment monopoly on information transfer could better  lead  to
the enfeeblement and, indeed, to the ultimate dissolution of
the Soviet empire than  the production of another dozen
missiles aimed at Moscow.

     But  's  the rub:  A "long enough" world view does
suggest that the evil, the oppressive, the coercive and  the
simply  stupid  will "get what they deserve," but what's not
immediately clear is how the rest of  us  can  escape  
killed, enslaved, or pauperized in the process.

    When  the  liberals and other collectivists began to at-
tack freedom, they possessed a reasonably  stable,  healthy,
functioning economy, and almost unlimited time to proceed to
hamstring   and   dismantle  it.    A  policy  of  political
gradualism was at least  conceivable.    But  now,  we  have
patchwork  crazy-quilt  economy held together by baling wire
and spit.  The state not only taxes us to  "feed  the  poor"
 also inducing farmers to slaughter milk cows and drive
up food prices--it then simultaneously turns around and sub-
sidizes research into agricultural chemicals designed to in-
crease  yields of milk from the cows left alive.  Or witness
the fact that a decline in the price of oil is considered as
potentially frightening as a comparable increase a few years
ago.  When the price went up,  we  were  told,  the  economy
risked  collapse for for want of energy.  The price increase
was called the "moral equivalent of war" and the Feds  swung
into  action.    For the first time in American history, the
speed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be-
came an issue of Federal concern.   Now, when the  price  of
oil  drops, again we risk problems, this time because Ameri-
can oil companies and Third World  basket-case  nations  who
sell  oil  may  not  be  able to ever pay  debts to our
grossly over-extended banks.  The suggested panacea is  that
government   now re-raise the oil prices that OPEC has
lowered, via a new oil tax.   the government is seeking
to raise oil prices to about the same extent  as  OPEC  did,
what  can we call this except the "moral equivalent of civil
war--the government against its own people?"

     And, classically, in international trade, can you imag-
ine any entity in the world except  a  government  going  to
  claiming  that  a  vendor  was  selling  it goods too
cheaply and demanding not only that that naughty  vendor  be
compelled by the  to raise its prices, but also that it
be punished for the act of lowering them in the first place?

     So   the statists could afford to take a couple of
hundred years to trash our  economy  and  our  liberties--we
certainly  cannot  count  on  having an equivalent period of
stability in which to reclaim them.   I contend  that  
exists  almost  a  "black  hole"  effect in the evolution of
nation-states just as in the evolution of stars.  Once free-
dom contracts beyond a certain  minimum  extent,  the  state
warps  the fabric of the political continuum about itself to
the degree that subsequent re-emergence of  freedom  becomes
all but impossible.  A good illustration of this can be seen
in the area of so-called "welfare" payments.  When  who
sup  at the public trough outnumber (and thus outvote) 
whose taxes must replenish the trough,  then  what  possible
choice has a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak-
ing  from  the few for the unearned benefit of the many?  Go
down to the nearest "welfare" office, find just  two  people
on  the dole . . . and recognize that between them they form
a voting bloc that can forever outvote you on  the  question
of who owns your life--and the fruits of your life's labor.

     So essentially  who love liberty need an "edge" of
some  sort  if  we're ultimately going to prevail.  We obvi-
ously  can't  use  the  altruists'  "other-directedness"  of
"work,  slave, suffer, sacrifice, so that next generation of
a billion random strangers can  live  in  a  better  world."
Recognize  that, however immoral such an appeal might be, it
is nonetheless an extremely powerful one in today's culture.
If you can convince  people  to  work  energetically  for  a
"cause," caring only enough for  personal welfare so as
to  remain  alive  enough  and  healthy  enough  to continue
working--then you have a truly massive reservoir  of  energy
to draw from.  Equally clearly, this is just the sort of ap-
peal which tautologically cannot be utilized for egoistic or
libertarian goals.  If I were to stand up before you tonight
and say something like, "Listen, follow me as I enunciate my
noble "cause," contribute your money to support the "cause,"
give  up  your  free  time  to  work for the "cause," strive
selflessly to bring it about, and then (after you  and  your
children are dead) maybe your children's children will actu-
ally  live under egoism"--you'd all  I'd gone mad.  And
of course you'd be right.  Because the point I'm  trying  to
make is that libertarianism and/or egoism will be spread if,
when, and as, individual libertarians and/or egoists find it
profitable and/or enjoyable to do so.    And  probably  only
then.

      I certainly do not disparage the concept of poli-
tical  action, I  believe that it is the only, nor even
necessarily the most cost-effective path  toward  increasing
freedom  in  our time.  Consider that, for a fraction of the
investment in time, money and effort I might expend in  try-
ing  to  convince  the  state to abolish wiretapping and all
forms of censorship--I can teach every libertarian who's in-
terested  how  to   use   cryptography   to   abolish   them
unilaterally.

       is  a  maxim--a proverb--generally attributed to
the Eskimoes, which very likely most Libertarians  have  al-
ready  heard.    And  you likely  not quarrel with
the saying, you might well feel that you've heard  it  often
enough already, and that it has nothing further to teach us,
and moreover, that maybe you're even tired of hearing it.  I
shall theore repeat it now:

     If you give a man a fish, the saying runs, you feed him
for a day.  But if you teach a man how to fish, you feed him
for a lifetime.

     Your exposure to the quote was probably in some sort of
a  "workfare"  vs.  "welfare"  context;  namely, that if you
genuinely wish to help someone in need, you  teach him
how to earn his sustenance, not simply how to  beg  for  it.
And of course this is true, if only because the next time he
is hungry,  might not be anybody around willing or even
able to give him a fish, whereas with the information on how
to fish, he is completely self sufficient.

     But  I  submit  that this exhausts only the first 
content of the quote, and if  were nothing  further  to
glean  from  it,  I  have wasted your time by citing it
again.  After all, it seems to have almost a crypto-altruist
slant, as though to imply that we  structure  our  ac-
tivities  so  as  to  maximize  the  benefits to such hungry
beggars as we may encounter.

     But consider:

     Suppose this Eskimo doesn't know how to  fish,  but  he
does  know  how  to hunt walruses.   You, on the other hand,
have often gone hungry  traveling thru  walrus  country
because  you  had  no idea how to catch the damn things, and
they ate most of the fish you could catch.  And now  suppose
the  two  of  you  decide to exchange information, bartering
fishing knowledge for hunting knowledge.   Well,  the  first
thing  to  observe  is  that  a  transaction  of  this  type
categorically and unambiguously utes the Marxist  premise
that  every  trade  must  have a "winner" and a "loser;" the
idea that if one person gains, it must necessarily be at the
"expense" of another person who loses.  Clearly, under  this
scenario, such is not the case.  Each party has gained some-
thing  he  did  not have before, and neither has been dimin-
ished in any way.  When it comes to exchange of  information
(rather  than material objects) life is no longer a zero-sum
game.  This is an extremely powerful notion.   The  "law  of
diminishing   returns,"   the  "first  and  second  laws  of
thermodynamics"--all  "laws" which constrain our possi-
bilities in other contexts--no longer bind us!   Now  that's
anarchy!

     Or  consider  another possibility:  Suppose this hungry
Eskimo never learned  to  fish  because  the  ruler  of  his
nation-state    had  decreed fishing illegal.   Because fish
contain dangerous tiny bones, and sometimes sharp spines, he
tells us, the state has decreed that   consumption--and
even    possession--are  too  hazardous to the people's
health to be permitted . . . even by knowledgeable,  willing
adults.   Perhaps it is because citizens' bodies are thought
to be government property, and theore it is the  function
of the state to punish  who improperly care for govern-
ment  property.    Or perhaps it is because the state gener-
ously extends to competent adults the "benefits" it provides
to children and to the mentally ill:  namely,  a  full-time,
all-pervasive supervisory conservatorship--so that they need
not  trouble  themselves  with making choices about behavior
thought physically risky or morally "naughty."  But, in  any
case,  you  stare stupefied,  your Eskimo informant re-
lates how this law is taken so seriously that  a  friend  of
his was recently imprisoned for years for the crime of "pos-
session of nine ounces of trout with intent to distribute."

     Now  you  may  conclude  that  a society so grotesquely
oppressive as to enforce a law of this  type  is  simply  an
affront to the dignity of all human s.  You may go far-
ther  and  decide to commit some portion of your discretion-
ary, recreational time specifically to the task of thwarting
this tyrant's goal.  (Your rationale may be "altruistic"  in
the   sense   of  wanting  to  liberate  the  oppressed,  or
"egoistic" in the sense of  proving  you  can  outsmart  the
oppressor--or  very likely some combination of  or per-
haps even other motives.)

     But,  you have zero desire to become a  martyr  to
your "cause," you're not about to mount a military campaign,
or  even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade.
However, it is here that technology--and in  particular  in-
formation technology--can multiply your efficacy literally a
hundredfold.    I say "literally," because for a fraction of
the effort (and virtually none of  the  risk)  attendant  to
smuggling in a hundred fish, you can quite readily produce a
hundred  Xerox copies of fishing instructions.  (If the tar-
geted government, like present-day America, at least permits
open  discussion  of  topics  whose  implementation  is  re-
stricted,  then that  suffice.  But, if the government
attempts to suppress the flow of information as  well,  then
you will have to take a little more effort and perhaps write
your  fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypted according to
your mythical Eskimo's public-key parameters.  But as far as
increasing real-world access to fish you have  made  genuine
nonzero  headway--which  may  continue to snowball as others
re-disseminate the information you have provided.   And  you
have not had to waste any of your time trying to convert id-
eological  adversaries, or even trying to win over the unde-
cided.  Recall Harry Browne's dictum  from  "Freedom  in  an
Unfree World" that the success of any endeavor is in general
inversely proportional to the number of people whose persua-
sion is necessary to its fulfilment.

     If  you  look  at  history, you cannot deny that it has
been dramatically shaped by men with names like  Washington,
Lincoln,  .  .  .  Nixon  .  . . Marcos . . . Duvalier . . .
Khadaffi . . .  and  ilk.  But it has also been  shaped
by  people with names like Edison, Curie, Marconi, Tesla and
Wozniak.  And this latter shaping has been at least as  per-
vasive, and not nearly so bloody.

     And  that's  where  I'm  trying  to  take The LiberTech
Project.  Rather than beseeching the state to please not en-
slave, plunder or constrain us, I propose a libertarian net-
work spreading  the  technologies  by  which  we  may  seize
freedom for ourselves.

     But here we must be a bit caul.   it is not (at
present)  illegal  to  encrypt  information  when government
wants to spy on you,  is no guarantee of what  the  fu-
ture  may hold.   have been bills introduced, for exam-
ple, which  have made it a crime  to  wear  body  armor
when government wants to shoot you.  That is, if you were to
commit certain crimes  wearing a Kevlar vest, then that
fact    constitute a separate federal crime of its own.
This law to my knowledge has not passed . . . yet . . .  but
it does indicate how government s.

     Other  technological  applications,  however, do indeed
pose legal risks.  We recognize, for  example,  that  anyone
who  helped a pre-Civil War slave escape on the "underground
railroad" was making a clearly illegal use of technology--as
the sovereign government of the United States of America  at
that time found the buying and selling of human s quite
as  acceptable  as  the buying and selling of cattle.  Simi-
larly, during Prohibition, anyone who used  his  bathtub  to
ferment  yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug,
alcohol--the controlled substance, wine--was using  technol-
ogy  in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agents
for his "crime"--unfortunately not to be  restored  to  life
when  Congress  reversed itself and re-permitted use of this
drug.

     So . . . to quote a former President,  un-indicted  co-
conspirator  and pardoned felon . . . "Let me make one thing
perfectly clear:"  The LiberTech Project does not  advocate,
participate  in, or conspire in the violation of any law--no
matter how oppressive,  unconstitutional  or  simply  stupid
such  law may be.  It does engage in description (for educa-
tional and informational  purposes  only)  of  technological
processes,  and some of  processes (like flying a plane
or manufacturing a firearm) may well require appropriate li-
censing to perform legally.    Fortunately,  no  license  is
needed  for  the   or receipt of information it-
self.

     So, the next time you look at the political  scene  and
despair,  ing,  "Well,  if 51% of the nation and 51% of
this State, and 51% of this city have  to  turn  Libertarian
before  I'll  be  free,  then  somebody might as well cut my
goddamn throat now, and put me out of my  misery"--recognize

I have seen various  to 'triple des' recently. Could anyone
tell me what it is ? From context, I  guess that it 
encrypting each block 3 times, with a different key each time, but
I'd like to be sure.

Replies by email perred - our news is unreliable.

At the risk of getting lost in the  chip discussion I give a

Unfortunately the answer is no - concealing the initialisation vector  
essentially doesn't give any additional security. I got 3 answers (from  
grady@netcom.com, Mark.Lomas@cl.cam.ac.uk, smb@research.att.com) that  
opened my eyes. It's pretty simple:

Say E is encryption (and D decryption) with key K on 64-bit blocks.

Let c[0] be the initialisation vector,
m[1], m[2], ... the message blocks,
c[1], c[2], ... the cipher text blocks.

Then encryption in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode works by the formula

   c[i] = E(m[i] XOR c[i-1]),

and decryption by

   m[i] = c[i-1] XOR D(c[i]).

So if the attacker doesn't have c[0] this only affects the first message  
block m[1]. But she can do her key search attack on m[2], m[3], ...

The situation in cipher feedback (CFB) mode is a bit more complicated but  
similar and left as an exercise for the reader :-)

Finally  is the modified output feedback mode (OFB) where DES (or  
whatever block cipher you use) simply acts as random generator by

   s[i] = E(s[i-1]) with initialisation vector (= seed) s[0],

and encryption is given by

   c[i] = m[i] XOR s[i].

Here the usual `known plaintext' attack against XOR-bitstream ciphers  
reduces the cracking to key search for K.

You're reading far too much into this (aside from the obvious fact
that you n't hold anybody to what they wrote in a 10 year old
book in a rapidly changing field like this.)


Quite simply she says that the security  not DEPEND on the
secrecy of the algorithm.  A secret algorithm can  be secure,
after all, we just  know it.  Only our level of trust is
affected, not the security of the system.

The algorithm *could* be RSA for all we know, which we believe to
be secure.

They have a much better reason to classify the algorithm than to
protect its security.  They want to protect its market share.

If they publish the algorithm, then shortly manufacturers 
make chips that implement the algorithm and standard but do not
use a key stored in .  And of course, everybody  buy them.


The whole push of this chip is that by establishing a standard that
you can only use if you follow  rules, they get us to follow
 rules without enacting new laws that we  fight tooth and
nail.

Quite simply, with  established, it  be much harder for
another encryption maker to define a new standard, to make phones that
can't talk to the leading phone companies.   The result is tappable
cryptography without laws forbidding other kinds, for 99% of the
populace.


To get untappable crypto, you  have to build a special phone that
runs on top of this system, and everybody you talk to  have to
have an indentical one.

That's the chicken and egg of crypto.  The government is using its
very special ability to solve chicken and egg problems of new
technologies to control this one in a way they like.


It's almost admirably clever.  When the EFF started, I posed the question here
"What are the police going to do when they wake up and discover they
can't wiretap?" and nobody here had an answer (or even thought it was
much of a question)

Then came the backdoor and Digital Telephony bills, which we fought.

Now we have  real answer, the cleverest of all.

I do not  they can use the eavesdropping as evidence at all. However,
using the info they gather  listening, they can go searching THE right
place and find good, strong evidence, which they can use in . 

Question : currently, it is easy to wire-tap, from the technical point of
view, at least. Anybody using the appropriate radio receiver can listen
to communications between a car-telephone and the ground station. The police
also, obviously. The  chip will make it much more difficult for the
non-authorized person to eavesdrop (note that I DO NOT write << impossible>> ).
The privacy will thus improve from the current situation. Poeple who 
have something to hide already DO NOT use the phone to speak of  things.
If an illegal operation is  worth, one can afford having critical data
carried by a person rather than sending it electronically. 
The  chip will not change this. 

The problem is more politic. Foreign countries will never accept the 
chip is the access to the  cannot be directly granted to  own
police following  OWN law, not the US law. i.e. each country will have
its own . How then will it be possible to monitor the international
traffic? or, will encrypted international traffic be possible ? or will 
be an international , some kind of U.N. thing ?

Forbidding crypted communication is impractical: how is it possible to spot
a crypted communication in the thousands of megabytes of data which circulate
on the various existing networks. What about private networks ? And this will
be more and more impossible as the volume of electronic traffic will increrase
in the next years.

I  that the  chip can only be an interesting device to limit the
risk of , for instance, one's girlfriend's husband listening to his wife's
communications. It will bring no more as regards to security. Is it worth ?
I  so if its cost is limited, I  that many privacy invasions are done
not only by official services, but also by private entities. The  can
help reducing . Provided we do not hope too much of it, it is not a real
danger and it can be helpful.

  Not necessarily.  For instance, in the system outlined in the May 1993
issue of "Byte", the process of getting one's public key listed for general
use involves giving pieces of your private key to  agencies, which
do calculations on  pieces and forward the result to the publishers of
the public key directory, which combines  results into your listed
public key.  If you try to give the  agencies pieces which --
yield your private key when they are all put together, the result is that
the public key listed for you is wrong and you can't read messages encrypted
to you.

I suspect the government feels it is enough to prevent companies from
offering secure encryption services.  Big companies  take that
kind of risk.  They're too visible and have too much to lose.

The US government may not have to make encryption illegal to prevent its
use.  If they could credibly say to IBM or MIT: you will receive no US
government money next year unless you follow  voluntary guide on
use of encryption, I doubt either   delay making use of
encryption a violation of local policies.  The US government gets much of
its power by making it impractical to operate without getting money from the
government  putting restrictions on use of such money that  be
illegal if they were enacted as laws.

You are correct (several times). TEMPEST is a codeword for a standard, shared between the NATO governments, to limit the inadvertent emission of information by either electromagnetic radiation or conduction. The limits set in the 
standard are classified but  is open source information to the effect 
that either the electrical or magnetic components of electromagnetism can be 
exploited. It is a basic rule of physics that  is an electromagnetic 
field associated with any path that conducts a flow of electrons.

Among other things, I drive a 1987 Korean built AT clone and an associated 24 pin dotmatrix printer. The major source of unintentional emission is the CRT. To that can be added the video driver card, the RS232 parallel cable and the 
printer head. The emissions from  are gross can be detected with the 
crudest of equipment. Were I to apply good test equipment and some 
intelligence to measuring emission levels, I  find many other potential 
sources of leaked information.

Where cryptography is used for serious purposes, poor TEMPEST protection 
becomes an important security hazard.

In the early eighties, the need to allow some commercial concerns, 
particularly financial institutions, a level of protection against TEMPEST 
threat led to a series of briefings to invited corporations and to the 
'release' of a cut-down TEMPEST stansard for commercial use. I say 'release' 
for  equipment to meet the standard is available (at a price and to 
approved customers) AFAIK even the commercial standard remains classified. If
you  about it, it   have to n't it?

        I  guess that they won't use  at all.  What they will
do is use  STU-IIIs amoung themselves and the governmental agencies
they need to talk to, and ignore .  After all, if it's not secure
enough for the agency/department they are communicating with why 
the coprations trust it?

Evil and good walk hand in hand.  It is also important to note that
the good in the tools lies in the wielder of the tools.

I cannot accept this ridiculous leap in logic.  Technology is neutral
to good or evil.  When technology is used by "evil" men, it is called
evil technology.  When it is used by "good" men, it is called good
technology.  , it is just technology that allows action to be
realized more efficently and on a larger scale.

Try not to confused the development of technology with its use.
Certainly, "bright" people will be better at creating technology, but
even young children know how to program VCR machines.  Are VCR
machines not extremely complex to create?

> It favors the adaptable (who are  quick  to  see  the

Adaptibility and flexibility is always better at enduring than the
stiff and stubborn.  A young child is soft and supple; an old man is
stiff and inflexible.  A dripping of water can cut through stone.
This has nothing to do with technology, rather technology just
allows us to magnify action.

 substances are normally not the secret, but how to get at them. The 
method of preperation is normally patented, which  that no-one else can 
make the chemical in the same way, without undergoing an agreement with 
American Cyanamid. (But I guess you knew what a patent is :-) )

If you know what substance is used, you'll also know its toxicity.

The Luminol reaction has the disadvantage of not lasting as long as the 
commercial version.

Remember that cyano compounds are found in nature, and not all are poisonous.

Let's put it this way, they have a charter and several executive s
to obey, among other things which *explicitly* prohibit sharing this
information (unless things have changed withing the last little ).
I suppose they could ignore it, if they choose.  But I doubt they .
For an authoritative look at the NSA, get Bamford's "The Puzzle Palace".
That's all I can say.

Okay, folks, I know I'm in the minority on this issue, but I can't
let this assertion go unchallenged yet again.  I'm going to say this
ONLY ONCE, in the hopes of NOT starting a flame war off of the main
topic.

Guns are offensive.  Cryptography is defensive.  See the difference?
The only way you can use a gun is to hurt somebody else.  Crypto-
graphy helps prevent other people from hurting you.

Sorry for the digression.  Let's not forget the issue that we DO
agree on: We want continued access to crypto technology of our
choice, without key registration.

Anything can be an emissions problem, right down to the video cable.  Given
the right equipment, you can pick the screen paint from the cable.  But,
given any cable, you must know what is  sent through it to know the
format of the signal, as well as how many wires, etc.

They are using some technology developed by VLSI systems, the other manufacturer of
the  Chips, that produces chips that are supposed to be highly resistant to
reverse engineering.

Er, people are going to make personal attacks on Prof. Denning whether she
posts here or not.  That much  be obvious from looking at the traffic
over the last few weeks.  Theore I conclude that the existence of personal
attacks is irrelevant to any decision concerning whether to post.

I suspect that Prof. Denning is actually using the attacks as an excuse for
not posting, and that the real reason for the silence is that  is not
the sort of proposal any self-respecting cryptographer can support via
reasoned argument.

That's one way to put it.  Keeping the algorithm classified  that 
disclosure of it falls under the rubric of "national security."  Nothing like 
federal marshalls to guard a monopoly...

Just a couple of days ago, I heard on the radio news that a Neo-Nazi
 had set up a BBS to keep its members informed.  According
to the radio man, the Nazis were using encryption to reduce  risk
if they were prosecuted.  No, I do not have any more information.

Have fun.

Nonsense.

Mike, in Heinlein's "Moon is a Harsh Mistress" decides that a weapon is some
mechanism which allows you to deliver energy at a distance.  (I 
have the book handy or I'd find the exact quote).

Guns do that.

Cryptosystems do not.

I   they can do that without changing the law.  The chip itself
isn't classified, and reverse engineering is allowed by law (possibly)
unless prohibited by a valid contract.  The algorithm may be classified,
but  are many  cases ruling that information identical to
classfied information, but obtained from unclassified sources, is freely
publishable (with the possible exception of nuclear weapon information.)

Yes -- great chapter.  Elizabeth Friedman (sp?) comes shining through.

However, the chapter also notes that  rum runners invented  own
crypto -- hired ex-military folks, in fact.  (How's that for a revolving
door?)

Now, given that today's rum runners (coke runners, actually) have even more
money than yesterday's, it's reasonable to expect them to have even better
cryptography.  I doubt they have a chip foundry of  own yet, but ....

So, my question of the FBI/NIST/NSA is: "How are you going to make the rum
runners use the  Chip?"

Answer:  	you're not.

Question:	OK -- in that case, your justification for taking away our
		rights has evaporated.  How do you justify our loss of rights
		if you can't use the drug dealers and terrorists?

As far as I can see, no matter how the session keys are generated (be it
Diffie-Hellman or whatever), any Cripple conversation which travels in
whole or in part over a land-line is vulnerable to this scheme.  Law-
enforcement agencies can do it legally at the telco, or illegally by finding
some part of the phone line that they can cut into.  The degree of risk
depends very much on location - not good in the middle of a busy street,
but not bad on a line in open country (leading to a drug lord's ranch).  The
only way to defeat it  be if your phone had the equivalent of a public
key indexed against phone number for every phone you might want to call (all
of them) - totally impractical, even if some part of the Cripple algorithm
could be used as a kind of public key (I  understand enough about 
things to know).

This sort of encryption scheme is only  workable over a radio link,
and even then you could probably interevene without causing problems for
other phones nearby if you were physically close to the target phone.

Gosh, yet another way to get round Cripple encryption.  How many is that
we've found so far?  And that's without even knowing the details of the
algorithm.

I  wish to rehash the PGP patent issue at all, but I do feel

You are correct that executing PGP  be a violation (unless the patent
were declared invalid by the s), but...   is a question as
to when, how, or if distributing PGP  be a violation.  If the person
or company distributing PGP receives money for doing so, then it is
clearly a sale (for example, if it were on Compuserve, they charge you
for access so they  be selling PGP).  When  is no charge for
PGP things get less clear, but    be a reasonable view
that it is inducing an infringement.

This is a common misconception.  The patent laws do not mention any valid
purpose for infringing a patent.  Although it is clear that in  to
create a new invention either based on a prior patent or to avoid infringing
a prior patent, one must perform research on an existing patent.  To
just say that you infringed a patent (assume we're not talking the RSA
patent) only for research purposes (wink wink, nudge nudge) and then never
develop any related invention (ie. only use it),  be a clear
infringement.

The same could be said for many other goverment agencies, but big budgets,
large staffs, and long lead time haven't made many of them into models of
effectiveness.

The fact is that  of us outside the inner circles have only James
Bamford's word that the people at the NSA use  legendary masses of
computers for anything other than reading netnews, like many of us.

The NSA *doesn't* have an impressive record of accomplishments, at least

n't this method be vulnerable against a "birthday" attack?
Currently a cracker needs to find the _only_ (*1) key that produces
the given ciphertext.  He has to try about 2^63 keys on the average.
In the proposed method the cracker only needs _any pair_ of key halves.
If he can store about 2^32 guesses for one half, he is likely to find
a mathching pair in about 2^32 guesses.  (Here I have assumed that the
DES-encryption is reversable, if the key is guessed.  Is this so or do
the modifications of the S-boxes by the salt bits make it non-reversable?)

*1 Probably  is only one key; I   is 1 chance in about 128
that  are two or more keys (can anyone verify this?), but this doesn't
help the cracker much.

I  the obvious answer (which may have been posted, but I haven't
seen it) is to encrypt your data with some other scheme, then run it
through .  The only way the police will be able to detect the
other encryption is through a wiretap, so even if they do notice with
an illegal wiretap, I have a hard time seeing a judge issuing a
warrant for a search to "confiscate" the illegal scheme (assuming that
at one day, it comes to this; a worse case) based on an illegal
wiretap.  Then again, maybe I am an idealist.  :>

O.K.- if you've read this group for a , you know all about the
one-time-pad, but here's a question I haven't seen.

The one-time-pad yeilds ideal security, but has a well-known flaw in
authentication.  Suppose you use a random bit stream as the pad, and
exclusive-or as the encryption operation.  If an adversary knows the 
plaintext of a message, he can change it into any other message.  
Here's how it works.

Alice is sending Bob a plaintext P, under a key stream S
Alice computes the ciphertext C = S xor P,  and sends it to Bob.

Eve knows the plainext P, but wants the message to appear as P'.
Eve intercepts C, and computes  C' = C xor P xor P' = S xor P'.
Eve sends C' to Bob.

Bob decrypts C' by computing  C'xor S = P',  thus receiving the 
false message which was substituted by Eve.


Now the question is how can this attack be defeated with information
theoretic security, not just computational security.
Can we define something like "ideal authentication" which is the
analog of ideal security.  Can we obtain ideal authentication ?

If not, how much can we limit Eve's control over the message ?

If we can achieve ideal authentication, does the solution use more
key bits or expand the message ?  Can we show the solution to be
optimal in one or more parameters ?

Does anyone know if  questions have been aswered before ?

One unreliable data point:  looking over the er of a

Yow! Am I ENCRYPTING yet?

Didn't we go over this guns'n'crypto discussion a few months ago? Must
we go over it again?

   I can  of a couple of ways of guaranteeing authenticity in a one-time
pad encrytped scheme, though I'm not sure how to prove that what kind of
authenicity they provide.
 
   An obvious first-attempt might be to prepend a truly random (unpredictable
for Eve) block to the message, and then calculate a CRC which included the
random starting block and all of the message.  This could be encrypted after
the message.  The problem is, I'm not sure it's impossible to come up with
a message that will hash to the same CRC regardless of the random starting
block.  (It intuitively seems like it ought to be hard, but I'm not *that*
sure....)  Clearly, a crypto-strength hash like MD5 or the SHA  be
stronger, but again, I'm not sure I'm comfortable claiming that it's
unbreakable.
 
   A scheme to use up some of the pad bits to decide how many bits of 0's
to include in the plaintext stream before going on n't be too bad,
either.  At the cost of increasing the speed with which you use up your
pad, this could be used to give you arbitrarily low probability that your
opponent could spoof a valid-looking message,  any deciphered plaintext
in a spot that  be carrying 0's will show that something funny's going
on.
 
   If, for each message bit M_i, we used up one random bit, R_i, to decide
whether to insert a 0 into the plaintext stream, we'd get a total pad use
of 2.5 times the message length.  (We'd expand the message size by about
half.)  Each 0 that  appear in the plaintext stream that doesn't is a
guess for our -be spoofer.  At each bit, she has to guess.  I'm trying
to see how to quantify her chances of making it all the way through the
spoofed message, but it gets a little complicated, because she can get un-
synched, and  happen to have a 0 in that place in the spoofed message.
 
   Now, I can see a simple way of doing this that's got to be as secure
as a one-time pad, at a cost of using 4 times the message length in pad bits.
 
   For each message bit, M_i, use one random bit, R_i, and xor them together
to get X_i.  Now, encrypt the three bits with the one-time pad.  The enemy
has no way of guessing what R_i is, so he/she can't guess what X_i is, either.
Any change she makes in the ciphertext stream will have to involve a guess
of what R_i was.  Is  any way to do this without using so many pad bits?
 
   Spoofing the message is equivalent to correctly guessing as many random
bits as  are bits in the message.  Clearly, this makes spoofing messages
just as hard if you know the whole message text as if you know none of it.
In fact, it looks to me like this makes it just as hard to generate a spoofed
message with the ciphertext as without it, but I'm not entirely sure about
that.
 
   Is  an easier way of doing this that's provably as secure as the
one-time pad?

Firstly, an aside:

I agree that the weakness exists, but I have a lot of trouble
believing that it represents a difficulty in real life. Given:

1. the purpose of the one-time pad is to give unbreakable security,
and the expense of key  etc., imply that the clients
 do want that level of security

2.  same people want to keep P a secret

I find it hard to believe that Eve might happen to have a copy of P
lying around.

(I am aware that the same argument applies to Eve knowing even a small
part of the message, but Eve must know EXACTLY where (which bytes) in
C her known susequence starts, or the result will be garbled. I find
this at least as surprising.)

Back to the question:

If I had the resources to use a one-time-pad for such transmissions, I
 also append a Message Authentication Code to the message, using up
the next bits of the one-time-pad as the key perhaps. Your original
question basically asked whether  was any way to authenticate the
message with the same degree of security as the Pad itself provided,
and I  know the answer. However, I  propose the following
for discussion.

Alice and Bob have an arbitrary number of secret, random bits to
share, which Eve doesn't know. She finds them out (effectively) by
knowing some P and the corresponding C. It is the fact that they
CORRESPOND that causes the problem. If a message authentication code was to
be created using some one-time-pad operation such that Eve could not
know which parts of the MAC were affected by which parts of the input,
she  be unable to forge a MAC to correspond.

What is required is a non-linear combiner of parts of the message.
(Non-linear so that simply xoring or subtracting or whatever doesn't
have exactly the same effect).

Now, at the end of the encrypted message C, Alice appends a n-bit MAC
computed as follows (S2  the next full chunk of the one time pad):
  1. compute C2 = P xor S2, and pad to an n-bit boundary with more of S
  2. break C2 into n-bit chunks
  3. set MAC to 0 (initialisation vector)
  4. for i in each chunk sequentially
       set MAC = MAC NLOP C2[i]

At the end of this process MAC is the Message Authentication Code.

(Bob verifies the MAC in the obvious manner; he recovers the
plaintext P, then uses some more of his pad to reproduce the MAC in
the same manner.)

NLOP is the non-linear operator, and  is the rub. The simplest
non-linear operator I can  of is an S-box; that is, have a fixed
(even published) permutation of the n-bit integers, an indexable table
called Sbox, and use:
  x NLOP y = x xor Sbox[y].

Practically speaking, I  this solves your problem, as Eve never
sees the intermediate output C2, and hence can't deduce S2 or perform any valid
substitution on it.

Also practically speaking, you want the MAC to be fairly large, say 32
bits, but you might not want a 4 gigabyte (say) S-box, so you might
work on 4 byte-sized S-boxes, but I  that is an irrelevant detail
for the discussion at hand.

Who will be first to point out my errors, or give me a pointer to some
literature?
